The Long Lost TBBT sequel you never knew you needed in your life,"&#x200B;

Hello everyone,

Fellow TBBT superfan here

Just wanted to say that I breathe TBBT and have watched SO many clips that I lost track of the number. So it made sense that a few months ago I got the idea to write a fanfic. Now it's out  and it would be great if you could check it out.

I'm really excited about my TBBT fanfic because I think it captures the spirit of the show and brings the characters to life in a way that I don't think has been done before. It's a story that really breathes new life into the show.

I am sure each one of you on this subreddit and reading this post wants to know SO BADD what the gang get up to in Pasadena. What I also know is that you want an alternate ending for Raj and you want to see Penny coping with her unexpected pregnancy

My fanfic will tackle al that and there is also a  cool Shamy arc and even COOLER Howie and Bernie arc.

I have linked the story below so would you kindly read the story and comment down below any thoughts or critique you have for me ( the more detailed the better) and  if u don't follow the A/N u will get spiders in ur bed!

Note: I included characters based on their number of episodes listed on imdb, excluding Halley (since she was a baby/child and had no lines) and Stephen Hawking and Mike Massimino, who played themselves.

I mean I thought Rajesh would finally meet his soul mate, but he is still left behind like he was in the beginning of the show, and I really would have liked to see Leonard and Penny having there baby together but the show ended on a somewhat cliff hanger. 

Plus the show ended a year before Covid and would have been really hysterical seeing Sheldon reacting to it. 

Was there like a reason the show ended?

Watching Young Sheldon for the first time! Thoughts so far.,"So I'm on Season 4 Ep 4 so far and I'm really liking it. The family is just so realistic, sometimes uncomfortably so. Notes:  


\-Everybody is so unnecessarily mean to Georgie! Despite what everyone says about him, he's actually pretty smart and responsible but his parents especially just don't give him any credit. He learned how to be a good salesman, got a job, bought the cable he wanted and bought himself a car all before being done high school, and even paid his boss his personal savings for the lost cash when he screwed up on his job. Nobody gives him any credit, stan georgie.

\-Missy is a girlboss, that's all. Shame it seems like she doesn't keep her wisecracks and streetsmarts as an adult (referring to her appearance in TBBT, though if I'm wrong about this forgive me, it's been a LONG time since I last saw TBBT)

\-Really genuinely shocked ol' meemaw didn't get back with Dr Sturgis, it really felt like they would get back together after the doctor was starting to feel regret. Don't care that much for the new dude but with how sitcoms usually go I feel like Dr Sturgis will get another chance.

\-Paige is a really interesting character and kind of sad so far, starts out as the young genius but gets more and more demoralized from where her smarts get her and is clearly suffering from what her family situation did to her. I hope things turn out well for her.

The gang decide to meet exactly 20 years from the present and only Stewart shows up. Is this canon? (S7E18),"At the end of the episode, after Raj's murder mystery game ends, the gang decide to meet in exactly 20 years for dinner. They all add it to their phone calendars. The scene cuts. 

It cuts a scene in the future. It shows the front of the apartment building which is their meeting spot. Stewart is the only one who shows up there - he's the only one to fulfil their pact 20 years earlier. 

Is this canon? Does this cutaway scene show the actual lore of this show in 20 years? If it does, it also shows something else. Futuristic, glowy smooth vehicles. I think this is quite silly for a 2 year prediction. It's a very cartoony presentation of future vehicles. 

So is this just a comedic cutaway? Many past and future scenes from shows are not necessarily canon, but some at least make this obvious. Here I'm a bit unsure. If it's canon, 1. That's shitty of everyone. 2. It's sad that it implies they're all too busy with their own individual lives. 3. Stewart was the only one to follow through, and he should be proud. This also implies they don't keep in contact with each other, or at least with Stewart. Otherwise they would have discussed it over messegss right? 4. Silly rediculous looking futuristic cars actually happen at least in this specific location (like their suburb). Who can say how such a shift in aesthetics occured.

(Please only vote once per day. This is just for fun! Yesterday's comments were consistent with the votes, so it seems like the honors system is working. Votes in comments below will not be counted, but feel free to discuss your favorites and least favorites!)

The Colonel is out! He was in 2nd place the previous day, so no big surprise. What is surprising is that some new characters are rising to the top, surpassing one character that's had a significant share of votes since day 1, when they came in 5th. Will that character hang in there as new ones are voted out? Every character received at least 2 votes this round as well, but the character with the fewest votes was different again - no consistent favorite has emerged yet!

Character ratings: 
	26. Colonel Williams
	27. Beverly 
	28. Anu
	29. Priya
	30. Lucy

I'll post a poll each day for you to vote for your least favorite character. Each day the character with the most votes will be eliminated. We'll see which favorites remain until the end! Check tomorrow's post for today's poll results.

So my dream was that I was part of a twin and my parents are Sheldon and Amy. My twin and I (i think we were like 13 or 15?) ordered food and she threw mine out of the window for fun and I was so upset that I ran to Sheldon and Amy's room ( I knocked three times just like Sheldon while calling out for Amy ) and I told Amy what happened and Sheldon like a dad told me to come to his side of the bed and comforted me while Amy was questioning my twin. When Sheldon was comforting me, he hugged me and started singing Soft Kitty which is weird because tht song is only for when we're sick. And then my dream shifted into a childhood flashback with me and my twin growing up with Sheldon and Amy. They were doing things like bringing us to Legoland, train rides and we're singing Darlin' by The Beach Boys in the car ride. Sheldon literally being a great dad in his own quirky ways.

Everyone bothers me from BBT,"I'll be getting a lot of hate for this, but I don't care. I just wanna say it.


1. Bernadette had no business in making that costume for Howard. It's between him and Sheldon. She is a vile person who's always overly hurtful to others. Self righteous woman with a superiority complex and little regard for others.


2. Amy is a creep. She's overly clingy, manipulative, and downright psychotic. And no, she's not pretty even if most of the people say otherwise. She looks like a goblin.


3. Howard was a creep, and he really likes to put others down. Even after that, he seemed like the most stable one by the end.


4. Raj is a spoilt brat who always wants more. Man had a girlfriend but broke up when he merely talked with another girl, already imagining having a relationship with the new girl. What an ass.


5. Penny was delt a bad hand by the writers. Poor girl had to settle for Leonard and drown herself in alcohol. An unfulfilled life and settling for what was available.


6. Sheldon definitely has ASD. Not all autistic people are like him, but not all are great as well, like Shawn Murphy. Sheldon was coddled when he was a kid, and his disorder was never addressed by anyone. If it was, he could've been helped. Mary Cooper's helicopter parenting created adult Sheldon.


7. Leonard is a narcissist. A self-centered, selfish, and manipulative man who would betray his friends for sex. He makes everything about himself. Despite Raj's protests, he hooks up with the guy's sister. If I was in Raj's place, I'd have beaten him black and blue. He had the gall to act betrayed when Raj and Penny seemingly hooked up. He tried to manipulate Sheldon into letting him woo Missy and put the other 2 down. 

Cheating, professional sabotage, lying to take advantage of others, forcing himself on Penny when she clearly wasn't interested and even manipulating her into having sex with him, superiority complex, extremely opinionated... Man will do anything for personal gain and pleasure. And, he's absolutely remorseless. 


Leonard reminds me of Ed Kemper.


I can't bear to watch the series anymore.

Sheldon‚Äôs character,"Everybody is constantly laughing off at Sheldon‚Äôs character. I don‚Äôt find that relatable. The guy makes total sense. If a person is to live a better life, it is important to care about small things. People make fun of him for having an enemies list, keeping track of his bowel movements, characterising his travel outfits according to weather occasion, having a weekly blast etc. but deep down it feels so soothing and fulfilling that someone is organised enough to maintain all that stuff. I personally look up to him and take ideas from his lifestyle to incorporate into mine.  

His opinions on gender blindness and stuff - I would love to see that in the real world. Im a girl and I‚Äôve personally seen my other girl friends reject the option of engineering because of it being a male dominated field. 

I mean I get it, he has quirks and is often oblivious to social cues  - that‚Äôs because the people in the show are so used to mocking him or treating him wrong that they fail to help him improve. Amy deserves a round of applause for being that person who helped Sheldon improve his emotional intelligence.

Overall, I would love a group of friends like Sheldon‚Äôs - altering the interest in video games and Star Trek and changing it into robotics.

Losing my interest,"Am I the only one that likes this series less and less with each watching... I used to be the hopeless romantic that cheered for Leonard when he and Penny were together and felt Leonads pain when she broke his heart. Now with each watching, I just get more angry at how Penny treats Leonard even after being married. And while on rare occasions they are shown as a loving couple, more often there is the angst that any moment Penny is going to leave Leonard for someone else and they continuously joke about it.  TBH in my opinion Penny and Leonard did have a more stable Loving relationship than the writers let us see.  But I am surprised that Howard didn't look at Bernie at one point and say I am done with this and left her because she turns into a mean woman.

The more I rewatch the show the more I dislike Bernadette,I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs because I was really young when Big Bang Theory first aired and so missed a lot of stuff but since it‚Äôs ending I‚Äôve rewatched maybe twice and now rewatching for a 3rd time and omg Bernadette is the worst! I‚Äôm on season 10 right now where someone from her work congratulated her on being pregnant and then she finds out Penny was the one who told on her. I guess what annoys me the most is how fixated Bernadette was on making Barbara Chen who she believed told everyone pay when she herself admitted that she had told everyone that Barbara Chen was pregnant which in turn cost her a promotion. Bernadette says that Barbara Chen screwed with her job and so she must pay for that possibly by finding ways to get her fired which is beyond hypocritical because she literally did the exact same thing to her and from the looks of it Bernadette didn‚Äôt get any payback seeing as she‚Äôs still thriving at work. There‚Äôs quite a few instances on the show and especially in her work environment where Bernadette is highlighted as being a horrible person and a bully but it‚Äôs particularly frustrating because the writers spin it into it‚Äôs okay and cute because she tiny and adorable and I wish at least once we‚Äôd seen her truly be called out for this behaviour. Even her yelling at Amy for getting Apple slices at McDonalds rather than French fries?!?! I think it would‚Äôve been nice to have her not be rewarded with the promotion by threatening her boss and rather for the promotion to have given been given to Barbra Chen which would have discredited any claims she had of discrimination and also if at some point in the episode she realised how wrong her behaviour towards Barbara Chen was rather than her self righteous attitude,,Character discussion,5,0.61,,False,True,13,bigbangtheory

Howard, however deals with new issues rather than old ones.
Becoming a father,  loosing his mother, a temporary career change from engineering to astronaut, having a steady girlfriend confront him about his past, having to separate from his unhealthy bond with his mother, overcoming a high achieving wife, etc etc.

New to the show,"So I just started watching BBT after all these years (started watching Young Sheldon before this lol), and currently, I am on season 5. So based on the seasons I have watched so far, I wanted to rank the characters based on their characteristics and whatnot. Please don't hate me, this is just my opinion.  


1) Leonard and Howard  
Probably the ones that seem the most normal out of the four guys. A perfect mix of socializing and brains. Leonard makes the most sensible decisions and looks like has some experience in life, but that could have to do with him being with penny. Howard is the only one who does not have a PhD, yet is still on par with everyone else and also the only one who has a degree in Engineering, setting himself apart from others. Although, it is a weird relationship between Howard and his mother, not because he is still living with his mom (totally fine), but with the way those two communicate like always screaming and shouting.

2) Penny and Bernadette   
Penny is the only character in the show who isn't academically driven which makes her stand out from the rest. She is funny and thinks practically and is basically how a normal person in todays world would live like. Bernadette also acts normally with reference to other people. She is smart but doesn't show it.

3) Raj  
He basically portrays of what it would be like to live as a person with such high stature in the academic world. Reading comics, shy around girls, only has a few friends, still afraid of his Indian parents etc. Throughout the show he makes really funny jokes in the sidelines. Something that doesn't seem right is his very very close friendship with Howard and there have been instances in the show where Howard's mother says is it the Indian boy who always comes around and sleeps in your bed and blah blah etc. 

4) Amy and Sheldon  
Sheldon in the BBT is basically a child genius stuck in the body of an adult. Him in the Young Sheldon and in big bang, are somewhat different. You'd think he would change and progress in his personality development as he ages, but he seems to just have gone a mark below. Although, he is pretty funny and makes some jokes which basically steal the show right from the start. His constant mockery of his friends as to how they are not very smart and indulge in normal life activities is kinda annoying. Amy is downright the character that I do not like. She is, idk how to say this but, irritating. Always thirsty for Sheldon and Penny as well. Like she literally keeps telling Penny to go naked and also kisses her when they are drunk in a few episodes. She also flirts with her all the time when they are together. Same goes with Sheldon, she constantly bickers him into kissing her and having intercourse with her even though he seems weirded out by this.  
I liked sheldon more in Young Sheldon than in BBT.

Frasier is a prime example of this. His story had much more to give after Cheers and Frasier was a completely different show but just as successful.

Binged the whole series in three months. My thoughts,"Well that's it, three months ago I'd never even seen a single episode, now I've seen them all. Well here is a short list of what I liked and disliked about TBBT.

What I like: 
- loads of funny moments
- the characters (most of the time)
- tons of great episodes
- the chemistry between the cast
- the guest stars
- the acting
- the sad/serious moments are well done
- the side characters
- the character development
- the weddings

What I disliked/hated
- the last three or so seasons were pretty boring
- The way Sheldon treats everybody (especially Amy)
- Bernadette became so unlikeable near the end
- abandoned plots, like the air force project.
- continuity errors
- overusing the audience laughter
- some bad or boring episodes
- too much fighting and drama between the couples
- Raj not getting a ending

Raj's gets Tenure, which initially annoys Leonard as he thinks he has done more than Raj. Sheldon doesn't really care since he consider himself so brilliant he'll never get fired so shows a rare form of happiness for his friend. 

A second later though we bring in Leonard being asked to decide who gets the funding (storyline from the latest season). Though Leonard doesn't give it to himself but picks the right candidate, this shows the university Leonard, while brilliant also has some leadership skills and soon becomes the Physic Department Head. In the last season he can become the Dean, and is the one to help Sheldon and Amy get their Nobel over the other candidates.

Howard's Dad's Letter,"In Season 6 Episode 19: The Closet Reconfiguration, Sheldon reads a letter from Howard's dad and at the end the group all give a version of the letter stating one of them is telling the truth.

Sheldon: The Goonies story

Amy: how his dad watched him graduate high school

Penny: how his other life caught up with him so he left so they'd stay safe

Leonard: how family is everything and shouldn't be thrown away

Bernadette: it was a photo of his dad holding a newborn Howard

I'm curious as to what you believe is the real truth? 
I want to say Amy's cause she seemed most attached/emotional but then Howard had a brother later turn up claiming to have the same dad so then that could have been the other life Penny spoke about. But I also feel it was one long letter and actually they were all telling the truth (bar Sheldon)

Storyline inconsistencies,"Not sure if this has been discussed already but I was rewatching the show and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how incoherent the storyline is. Like did the writers make a note of what they were saying in previous episodes at all??

- Sheldon getting confused by Raj speaking in Hindi: ‚Äújo ji kare kar - whatever floats your boat‚Äù but then he said in a later season that he learnt Hindi when he was 8 years old?? Also Raj said in the later seasons that doesn‚Äôt underhand Hindi as he never spoke it as a child.

- Sheldon being anti-cats in S1 when Leonard was heartbroken and listening to emo music then ended up getting 6 cats when he and Amy broke up in S4.

- S6 Penny saying she knew tons of people that got married in Vegas and then suggesting Howard and Bernadette get married there when they couldn‚Äôt finalise a venue. But then in S8 she said that she got married to Zack in Vegas as a joke because Vegas weddings were fake. 

- Sheldon suggesting Penny‚Äôs mum was fat when she takes the last dumpling that was meant for the most respected member of the group but in S9 when her family visit for the wedding, Penny‚Äôs mother is fairly lean. 

Does anyone else still love the show but feels like the inconsistency of the storyline makes it a little difficult to watch it again?

Edit- also as a young Sheldon fan, the two shows rarely have any similarities. Grown up Sheldon‚Äôs version of his childhood is so distant from young Sheldon‚Äôs life. Like him saying his parents got him a dirt bike for his 11th birthday but watching YS I can tell his parents knew him very well and would never have gotten him a dirt bike.

Sexism in The Big Bang Theory,"This genuinely isn't a hate post, just my perspective on the sexism on the show and since the show would often call out other shows all the time for unfair representation like The Simpsons (which I honestly think has done much less offensive representation compared to their portrayal of Raj), I thought I'd share some moments I think we brushed over too much:

My personal edit: Please, actually read it. This is just my perspective and I'm not trying to cancel your show, you can like what you like but people criticize my favorite shows all the time and I still hear them out whilst still enjoying what I enjoy. The response has been so unexpectedly hostile and I just like debating issues I'm passionate about, I'm not trying to ruin what you enjoy. If people could not respond with sexist name-calling and slurs, that would be appreciated. The irony is that a lot of the responses are about free speech when that's all I'm exercising.

Howard giving Penny a teddy bear with a webcam in

Sheldon saying Marie Curie was an 'honorary man' because of her accomplishments in science-

Sheldon saying to Penny ' The trouble isn‚Äôt with me, Penny, it‚Äôs with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle'

Leonard enabling Howard and Raj when they sent military satellites and robot aircraft off course so they could spy on the models at the American Next Top Model house when they were topless.

Howard and Raj then even posed as electricians to trick the girls into letting them into their house-

When Penny finally defended herself to Howard and the guys made her feel bad about it so SHE apologized to HIM for defending herself against his constant sexual harrassment. There's also instances where she's literally just trying to eat dinner and he's hitting on her constantly like when she responded by saying 'Not with a thousand condoms, Howard' so he keeps it going by saying 'Oh so there IS a number' (some of these are quite harmless on their own but they're alarming when they're all laid out together)

Howard operating a remote control car to drive under Penny's skirt then after the boys laughed for a while, Raj said 'You might want to put some underwear on'

The show also contributed to that disturbing sitcom trope where they'd talk about getting girls drunk to make them easier to hook up with as if that's ok

I remember hating Sheldon's assistant as a kid but now that I've re-watched the things he said to her, she was right to report him - an actual sentence he said to her 'Your ovaries are oozing so much goofy-juice into your brain that you don't know which way is up'

Whenever Penny is upset, Sheldon asks if she's on her period or offers her products that would imply she is - he even estimated how many periods she'd have left and once even asked if she was regular

When Raj literally convinced Penny they'd had sex (which is a crime by the way) and then we he finally told her, it wasn't even because of the emotional distress she was going through, he told her after her relationship when Leonard had already been affected and then made her promise to keep it a secret

Raj being extremely misogynistic but never facing consequences because he was drunk e.g. that time he stripped off in front of a woman in a coffee shop or propositioned a woman interviewing him for a job at the university to move the interview to his hot tub but then told the rest of his friends he didn't get the job because she was racist - there's a difference between guys being nervous around women and guys just committing sexual harassment

Sheldon said to his female lab assistant 'Women are like an egg salad sandwich on a warm day: full of eggs and only appealing for a short time '

All the dumb blonde bimbo/Penny being a slut because she'd slept with multiple guys jokes they'd make that seemed to spill over into the real-life harrassment Kaley Cuoco who plays Penny would get from male fans of the show. I've seen so many forums online calling her disgusting names and saying they'd prefer Bernadette purely because she was more 'virginal' when regardless of her sexual history, Penny was a much better friend/person

The double standards with the shit Penny got for hooking up with Raj when she didn't actually compared to Penny just having to get over Leonard cheating her, Sheldon never disclosing his assistant kissed him and choosing to work with her despite knowing she had a serious crush on him whilst he had a girlfriend, Howard constantly flirting with other girls despite being engaged and then married to Bernadette; after Penny pointed out 'You're engaged to my best friend', Howard replies 'Bernie doesn't mind where I get my motor running as long as I park in the right garage'. He also constantly comes out with seemingly harmless jokes that become unbearably creepy when you put them all together and also acknowledge that he just goes up to women and these are the first things he says like 'You turn my software into hardware'  and 'What up, science bitches?' He would say uncomfortable lines like 'The way I see it, I'm halfway to pity-sex' or how Leonard would always discuss his sex life with Penny without her permission and Howard would say things like 'You got her to have sex with you; obviously, your power is brainwashing'

The way Howard expected Bernadette to have his children then stay at home to raise them despite her making more money than him/being more of an accomplished scientist and since he was the one to want kids - not her - he should have been raising them. He also expected her to clean up after him/cook for him like his mum used to and she did!

How the show never gave Penny a surname until she married Leonard

Them referring to Penny as white trash because she came from Nebraska

Money is not a reflection of love but Howard buying Bernadette a half a carat for a ring when he can clearly afford more and telling his cousin 'her freakishly small hands make anything look big'- Penny ending up pregnant when she never wanted kids felt like a huge betrayal to her character - especially since she agreed to Leonard being a sperm donor to her ex-boyfriend's new wife

There's an episode where Sheldon and Amy combine their genes/brain cells and after its success, he not only tells Bernadette that theirs is more advanced than the baby she's currently pregnant with but he then tries to persuade Amy multiple times to make a baby with him. After she repeatedly tells him no, he decides 'She's playing hard to get' and takes more drastic action to 'seduce' her which is just an incredibly problematic mindset

Sheldon saying 'I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman'

Howard saying to Leonard and Raj 'My wife came with both fun bags and money bags' to which they both laugh

Howard not wanting Bernadette to be friends with other guys in earlier seasons because Leonard was interested in her work and how Leonard later on constantly made comments about wanting Penny to quit acting because A: he essentially wanted to date a girl who seemed smarter so he could finally get approval from his mother and B: he was always incredibly jealous of any guy she'd have to work with on set which was her literal job

Sheldon saying to Penny 'No-one can be that attractive and skilled at a video game'

I'll finish this with Sheldon and Raj arguing over which Bollywood actress is better between Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit: Sheldon calls Aishwarya Rai 'a poor man‚Äôs Madhuri Dixit' to which Raj says: 'Aishwarya Rai is a goddess - by comparison, Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute'. Netflix received legal action to remove this episode from their platform for derogatory comments.

&#x200B;

A lot of people are going to say 'It's just a show' which is the entire problem; I'm fully aware but I just want to have a fair discussion about its effects on certain members of its audience because it feels like no-one cares and I used to love the show as a kid but grew up realizing this was a show that only loved a portion of its viewers.  Another argument is that Sheldon didn't seem to realize he was being mean/he was inept of social cues...except he actually just got to a point where he seemed fully aware of the things he said but just didn't care; others would point it out and he even learned to recognize his nastiness on his but the show seemed to stick with the idea 'We can write whatever crap we want because we've established this character doesn't know it's wrong so we've found a loophole and don't need to address it'. Lots of people enjoyed this show but lots of people were hurt, I still find it entertaining but you can still like the show and also acknowledge that these things are not ok.

Edit: It seems most people ignored everything I've said or even refused to read it and have just responded with hateful criticism instead of having a discussion which unfortunately proves my point. There are also many other issues which need to be covered but I'm just focusing on the sexism angle.",,Character discussion,0,0.49,,False,True,131,bigbangtheory

First time watching the *entire* show and here's my thoughts," 

I've been a fan of ""The Big Bang Theory"" for a long time, and I feel like a part of this quirky community. Each character is special to me, but I have to say that two characters in particular, Raj and Amy, have a lot of issues.

We all know that every character is flawed, but the rest of the cast seems to make up for their flaws with other good traits or through self-improvement. For example, Penny grows from being a bully to recognizing when she's wrong and considering others' feelings. Howard starts as a pervy, sex-obsessed character, but over time, he becomes a dedicated father and loving husband. Bernadette can be spiteful, but she usually feels bad about it quickly. Leonard learns to stand up for himself and not let Penny walk all over him, while Sheldon, despite being the least redeemable, still shows growth in his relationships and independence.

However, Amy and Raj seem to be the exceptions. Amy starts out as a quiet, intelligent woman with a snarky tone, but over time, she becomes a sex-craved pervert who treats her best friend like a sex object and talks about her best friend's husband like he's trash. She also deliberately sets Sheldon off any chance she gets to cause drama between his friends. One example is the Halloween party, where Howard dresses as Sheldon and makes tame jokes about him. Sheldon gets offended and sulks in his office. Instead of telling Sheldon to grow up, Amy gaslights Bernadette into thinking Howard is in the wrong. When Bernadette explains how Sheldon constantly belittles her husband, Amy spitefully ruins the Halloween party by showing up dressed as Bernadette and Howard, insulting Bernadette's voice, height, and body. Amy is a toxic, delusional character who feeds into Sheldon's ego and selfishness, and she constantly talks badly about him behind his back. She's great when she's not with Sheldon, but when they're on screen together, she's a horrible human being and a terrible friend.

As for Raj, he's a spoiled man-child who gets everything handed to him. Even seven seasons in, when everyone else has sorted their lives out and started to become better people, Raj is still lying, manipulating, twisting the truth, and leeching off both his friends and family. He's consistently ungrateful and disloyal to his friends, often gaslighting them and ignoring their boundaries.

For instance, Raj has been known to break into Howard's house multiple times just to use his Jacuzzi and has a habit of turning important moments in Howard's life into Raj-centric pity parties. In one episode, he gaslights Howard into thinking that he caused all of Raj's problems just because he made light-hearted jokes at his expense, despite Raj doing the same to Howard.

His behavior is genuinely psychotic at times, such as when he backstabs Penny after she discovers a comet, gaslights her, and then tries to guilt trip her and Leonard into letting him get away with it. Even in later seasons, Raj continues to mistreat the people who love and support him. For example, when Howard gets invited to speak at Raj's planetarium, Raj's first reaction is an outburst in front of his boss, screaming that Howard isn't allowed to do it out of pure jealousy and spite. In another instance, Raj gets a big break on TV but spends the entire interview badmouthing Neil deGrasse Tyson simply because he's envious of Tyson's success and respect.

Raj also contributes to his parents' divorce by spreading rumors and falsehoods, all for his own financial gain. In his romantic life, he dismisses Emily, the only woman who genuinely loved him, because she was a bit too kinky in bed. It seems that Raj doesn't really want a partner with a personality, but rather a submissive sex slave who'll cater to his every whim.

Every character has bad moments and good moments, the difference is that everyone else seems to learn and grow from the bad while enjoying the good but Amy and Raj try their absolute best to cause drama and hatred to spread within the group at every turn, all the while showcasing horrible, twisted personalities that are revealed anytime someone says as much as ""no"" to them or disagrees with a horrible thing they've done. They genuinely nearly ruined the show for me but luckily other characters made up for them.",,Character discussion,9,0.7,,False,True,28,bigbangtheory

Raj a typical Indian boy,"I love Raj and His Character development on the show. From season 1 to 5 the way his character progressed was something to watch. He is sweet but a hypocrite. He is shy but proud.  He loves America but dislike his own country. He loves beef and still respects his Religion. He loves women yet he is all hypocrite when it comes to his sister , Priya. All of his dialogue and his  conversations with Howard about racism and women are apt.

After season 5 his character became too imaginative. He became a loner and desperate for love. I mean if you have a degree from Cambridge and come from a rich Indian family. You will either be spoilt or too humble for this world. Raj is a spoilt child. It is too unusual to have a character development like this and its disappointing. There could have been so many darker jokes made out of his character. I don't know why they had to make him such a cutiepie and sad while the rest of them were settling in their life . The truth is a Indian guy would be married off first and already be having two kids.

The Scavenger Hunt Episode is just so great,"I've always loved the big bang theory since watching reruns on TV like 10 years ago as a teenager with limited access to entertainment. 

A couple years back I watched the whole thing through to the end and did enjoy it, but agreed that there was a noticeable dip in quality in the later seasons. I started rewatching a few weeks ago, but as the seasons have gone on I've increasingly just been half watching while doing other stuff. It's a nice comforting background show that didn't demand my full attention. 

The scavenger hunt episode, though, made me sit up and take notice. I was glued to the screen throughout the episode and there was just so much I liked about it. 

The Big Bang theory back in season 1 started with such a simple premise that was inevitably starting to wear thin after multiple seasons since the show was more successful than anybody probably expected. Therefore, it made sense to have more of an ensemble cast and give the show more longevity by building up the different dynamics between characters and allowing them to play off of each other. 

The scavenger hunt does this is an interesting way by creating pairs that aren't usually seen interacting one on one (except Sheldon and Penny but I'll get to that). The pairs work great together and the episode as a whole is just a delight in the way it deviates from the normal structure of mainly group scenes talking with everyone being reasonably relaxed, to a more fast paced and competitive setting where you get a lot of one on one interactions outside of the usual Leonard/Sheldon, Leonard/Penny, Howard/Raj, and Howard/Bernadette, which are really the main common 1 on 1 dynamics seen in the show. 

Pair 1: Penny and Sheldon

Now Penny and Sheldon were the least exciting pair for me because they are seen interacting relatively regularly, and seeing them talk or be at odds or tension with each other isn't new. Still, though, it's a pleasant pairing, as even though Sheldon/Penny isn't a novel prospect like the others, it is a winning combination in my view, and having read this subreddit, it seems a lot of others agree with my opinion that they're good together. Through sheer familiarity the two are very comfortable with each other despite being probably the two most different characters on the show. Sheldon is probably one of the only men Penny has interacted with as an adult who isn't remotely interested in her romantically, and this is a double-edged sword for her as it means he won't make unwanted advances on her, which means she is more comfortable. However, he also won't pull punches with her and will call her out on things (her messy apartment, her check engine light, etc.) That a lot of guys wouldn't, because they're worried about offending her and ruining their chances with her. After years in each other's companies the two are both well aware of each other's idiosyncrasies and flaws, and have long since come to terms with them. They have a nice thing going on where Penny helps Sheldon with social skills and processing emotion, while Sheldon helps her improve her general knowledge and be better informed about the world. In a lot of ways, how well they worked together in the scavenger hunt was emblematic of how beautifully two people you'd think would never get on have grown together. Penny respects Sheldon's problem-solving skills and the two generally encourage each other, despite the bickering over things like the bowling ball that are inevitable between two people who are so close. Their scenes were fun, but nothing overly revolutionary compared to what the rest of the show had already built between them. 

Pair 2: Howard and Amy 

Howard and Amy are two characters that essentially have nothing to do with each other, and this is made clear by their initial awkwardness in the car together. However, it was great seeing them bond over Neil Diamond as they both do have a similar goofy/childlike nature when their guard is down, and both are used to having unusual interests that others don't find accessible, so their mutual bliss at having something in common to bond over is really beautiful. As funny as the Neil Diamond obsession was, though, I do wish that they had used it to further develop a more meaningful friendship between Howard and Amy, rather than just extending that one joke for the whole episode and calling it a day, it's one of my few gripes with this episode. 

Pair 3: Leonard and Bernadette

Leonard and Bernadette were by far my favourite pair of the video. Bernadette is well and truly a main character at this point and it is strange that we as the audience know almost nothing about her relationship with Leonard. I have mixed feelings about Bernadette's mean quips usually, some are hilarious and some are a bit meh, but I love her this episode and it was definitely my favourite pairing comedy-wise. When she's criticising Leonards driving while talking about how he didn't get put on a team with Penny and goes ""I'm starting to think she dodged a bullet... the slowest bullet it the world"" I had a good laugh. It was all in the delivery and I felt her heckling of Leonard was funny without crossing the line into excessive meanness. It would have been nice to see the two reconcile and bond a little more, but I suppose it at least gives insight into why the two don't interact more regularly.

Mary vs Beverly,"This is probably going to be a very unpopular opinion, but brace yourself. 

In TBBT, we always see how Mary is a great mother to Shelly, while Beverly is despicably awful towards Leonard. That's something everyone can agree on. 

But we also hear how Beverly seem very proud of Leonard's siblings. And even in TBBT, but especially in Young Sheldon, we see how Mary is at best dismissive of Missy and Georgie, because she loves and care for Shelly a gazillion time more. And no matter how much of a selfish brat Sheldon is, or how much emotional support Missy tries to provide her - let alone how Georgie provides and support her and Missy after George death. It's always about Shelly in her mind and heart. 

So this all makes me wondering. If we had the perspective of Michael Hofstadter or his sister on Beverly as a mother. Or Missy and Georgie's perspective of Mary as a mother. Now, obviously, for one thing, Mary did not write books about how Georgie and Missy were a constant disappointment to her, so that's a good point for her that she kept that for private audience. But with what we see in Young Sheldon, I'm starting to think that Mary and Beverly, on many regards, are just to other side of the same coin to Sheldon and Leonard (and/or to their other kids). 

Beverly is certainly worse, but Mary still has a lot in common with her when it comes to Missy and Georgie...",,Young Sheldon,42,0.83,,False,True,20,bigbangtheory

""As the final episode of The Big Bang Theory comes to a close, the gang sits around in their apartment, reminiscing about all the good times they've had together over the years. Suddenly, there's a loud explosion outside, and the lights in the apartment flicker.

The gang rushes to the window to see what's happening, and they see a massive mushroom cloud rising up in the distance. It becomes clear that a nuclear bomb has gone off, and the world as they know it is coming to an end.

With tears streaming down their faces, the gang holds each other tightly as they realize that they'll never get to experience any more adventures or make any more memories together. They're all going to die, and there's nothing they can do about it.

As the radiation begins to seep into their apartment, the gang huddles together and tries to stay strong, but it's no use. One by one, they begin to succumb to the effects of the radiation poisoning, until eventually, they're all gone.

The final shot of the series is of the empty, radioactive apartment, as the camera pans out to show a desolate wasteland where once there was a bustling city. The laughter and joy that once filled that apartment are gone forever, replaced only by the sad silence of a world that's been destroyed.""",,Other,7,0.66,,False,True,4,bigbangtheory

The Evolution of Penny: A Tribute to the Amazing Character,"Let's take a moment to appreciate the evolution of one of its most beloved characters: Penny.

From the very first episode, we were introduced to Penny as the beautiful, outgoing waitress who lived across the hall from the nerdy and socially awkward Leonard and Sheldon. She was initially portrayed as a stereotypical ""dumb blonde,"" but as the series progressed, her character developed into so much more.

Throughout the show's 12 seasons, we watched Penny grow and evolve in remarkable ways. She went from a struggling actress to a pharmaceutical sales representative and eventually, a successful businesswoman. She faced challenges in her personal and professional life, including failed relationships, career setbacks, and struggles with addiction.

But through it all, Penny remained a strong and resilient character, with a kind heart and an infectious personality. Her relationship with Leonard was a central theme throughout the series, and we saw her mature and learn to navigate the complexities of love and commitment.

Beyond her romantic relationships, Penny's friendships with the guys were also a highlight of the show. She initially struggled to understand their quirky interests and intellectual pursuits, but over time, she came to appreciate and embrace their unique personalities and passions.

One of the most remarkable things about Penny's evolution was how relatable and realistic it was. She wasn't a perfect character, and she made mistakes along the way, but she always learned from them and grew stronger as a result.

As we look back on the show, it's clear that Penny was an integral part of the ensemble cast, and her evolution throughout the series was a testament to the show's strong writing and character development.

So here's to you, Penny - thank you for making us laugh, cry, and root for you throughout the years. You will always hold a special place in our hearts.

Sincerely,
A fan of ""The Big Bang Theory""",,Character discussion,173,0.96,,False,False,13,bigbangtheory

I don't care what anyone says about season 12,"I love season 12. It's by far my favourite season because of how impactful it is. Spoilers ahead:

 Sheldon and Amy work in super-asymmetry, and then they grieve their work when they find out it was disproven years ago. But then Sheldon finds encouragement from the last source he ever thought he would, his late father, imparting his wisdom one last time.

Raj comes to terms with his loneliness and his issues, and realizes that he doesn't need to marry Anu just because he's running out of time, his perfect woman is out there somewhere.

And the most impactful one for me was Leonard finally accepting his mother, and forgiving her for hurting him, and more importantly forgiving himself for agonizing over her for years. As someone who has their own parental issues, Leonard has always been a character very close to my heart, and seeing him grow like this makes me realize that I probably can, too.


Of course I don't expect everyone to agree with me, but I think season 12 was one of the best ones in the show.",,Storyline discussion,87,0.87,,False,True,15,bigbangtheory

She made herself being the maid of honour at Bernie's wedding seem like a bigger deal that Bernie's wedding. She wanted the world to just revolve around her. 


I also hated how she was performing a series of experiments on Penny like asking her to solve puzzles or taking out a banana from a box and comparing results with chimps. Her being Penny's best friend never made sense to me. When Leonard and Priya got together she kept pointing out how Priya is better than Penny every chance she got. 


Also, when Penny and Bernadette had a rift, she was literally happy about it and sucking up to each of them every chance she got.

Random scenario with a second prodigy in Sheldon's family,"As I said in a previous post of mine, I have been curious about what things would be like if there was a second child prodigy in Sheldon's family and is a male.

* He wears glasses
* He would have an IQ of 187 while Sheldon would have 188
* He is an Engineer and has a doctorate in it (if I could think of anymore degrees and in which fields, I would add them)
* His relationship with Sheldon is a bit tense and strained, but, unlike Sheldon, prefers not to do competitions against each other
* He is more appreciative towards George, Georgie and Missy and he considers them some of his idols and prefers to not always listen to Mary, unlike Sheldon.
* He has no social skills but he is a very nice guy.",,Storyline discussion,0,0.14,,False,True,11,bigbangtheory
