“The Good Ones” is a good episode in my opinion,"[This is my first time watching from the beginning of season 6]

I found the episode incredibly cathartic and enjoyable because of the self-awareness it took a cop show, let alone a comedy programme, to acknowledge and address the profound problems in policing in the United States. 

The sub-plot with Charles was funny (to me), and the main plot line, with the female captain running through why they can’t fire two police officers for assaulting that woman needs to be known by more people. 

Honestly I knew this episode was coming thanks to its clear lowest ranking on all the rating infographics and all the references to “a political episode” in comments on here; but having a black man murdered on camera by a police officer, and a literal attempted coup trying to overthrow an election meant that the writers couldn’t simply continue with their cop based programme.

How is it that Holt wasn’t able to understand Monty Hall?,"I get the whole „Boooone“ thing, but someone as smart and knowledgeable as Holt shouldn’t have an issue with a statistics problem people learn and solve in 9th grade.

EDIT: To understand it, think about it like this (assuming you are familiar with the general concept):

„If your initial guess is wrong, you always win by switching. You initial guess is wrong 2/3 of the time“

EDIT NO. 2: Here’s my best long form explanation:

Let‘s say each door gets a letter, A, B and C. A and B are wrong, C is right, but you don’t know it, the show host obviously does, after your first pick he opens a wrong door you didn’t also pick.

1. 

So your first pick is A, the host therefore can only open B, as A is your choice and C is the right door. 

After that, you switch, your only option for that is C, the right one, and you win.

2.

Same goes for B as your initial guess. Show host has to open A. You switch to C, again your only option if you switch. You win again.

3.

Only when you pick C, the host can decide to opens A or B, if you switch to the one he didn’t open, you lose.


So if you always switch, there are two initial choices where you win, only one initial choice where you lose.

So if your initial choice is wrong, you automatically win by switching. Only if your initial choice is right you lose by switching.

And your initial choice is wrong 2/3 times due to the 3 doors. So if you switch you win 2/3 rounds.",,Discussion,77,0.84,,False,True,127,brooklynninenine

Both Amy and Jake were right in what they did wrt having their baby.,"Seeing some posts against Amy Santiago that she manipulated Jake and then glorifying Jake that he made some enormous sacrifice.

So, here is my take on it.

>!Amy was 100% right in the Casecation episode. The only reason she gave an ultimatum was justified, because, as she says, as a woman, she might not be fully fertile 2 years down the line. So, if two years later, Jake still wouldn't come around, no loss for him. But, for her, she would have to find someone else, get married and then have a baby and it might be years before that. She fought for what she wanted. That's it.!<

>!Jake was never manipulated. The bomb scare made him want to have a baby of his own. He came to the decision of his own accord. Nothing on Amy here. !<

>!As for him giving up his police career, there was no ""sacrifice"" there. One of them had to stop working to take care of the baby. Obviously, it will be the one who has progressed less in their career that will have to give it up. Amy was already a Sergeant and well on the path to become Captain or take her police reforms into greater heights. Jake was still a detective and not even written the Sergeant's exam. It is obvious that Jake would be the one who stops his career.!< He was 100% right in his decisions as well.

The only episode where Amy and Rosa show both ignorance and incompetence,"This episode really grates my teeth for the following reasons:

- The B99 gang has dealt with a myriad of suspects and cases all with varying circumstances, backgrounds and evidence
- How do two veteran detectives (one of them  arguably one of the best in the precinct itself) immediately dismiss this guy as a criminal SOLELY because of his age and looks?
- I know this has happened once before (Neighbourhood watch superman version 0.5) but this pissed me off on how Amy and Rosa call out Charles' detective skills without a second thought
- Charles literally said he found the robber which I assume means he acquired the necessary evidence and witnesses to corroborate his arrest (Charles has been shown to be patient and methodical THROUGHOUT the series) 
- What makes this ""suck salad"" even more suckier is that Rosa and Amy THEN go test the bills the old man gave them in order to check out Charles' claim ONLY AFTER he stood his ground about how he is a good cop. - There was no need to go validate Charles' work when HE ALREADY presumably spent copious amounts of time figuring this out
- I feel this was not only a slight to Charles as a good detective but also showed how narrow-minded Amy and Rosa were IN THIS EPISODE (they are usually very insightful, intelligent and thoughtful)

just found an error on the timeline of the show,"okay so, according to the timeline jake and amy get engaged on **october 31, 2017** and get married a few months later, on **may 15, 2018**.  their 1 year anniversary is shown on episode 12 of season 6, casecation.

up until that point everything is fine THEN

four episodes later we get to the heist episode on cinco de mayo, **10 days before** paraltiago's anniversary, in which they refer to the 2017 halloween heist as their last one, reiterating how the 2018 one had to be canceled (irony haha) due to the explosion.

obviously there's no way a whole year passed in four episodes, and it was also not a flashback since we have the lieutenant budget deal with terry, so it's undoubtedly an error.

A season 8 storyline that actually bothers me (NOT about “politics”),"I actually like/don’t mind season 8 - sue me. It’s really not as political as people make it out to be, but that’s neither here nor there. But there’s one plot point that actually makes me angry. 

In season 3 episode 23, Captain Holt says “for the last time - not all grown-ups *have* lake houses,” which heavily implies that he does not have a lake house. If he did, that is a place the NYPD doesn’t know about where they can go, which is why Jake suggests it in the first place. Then all of a sudden in season 8, he and Kevin *have* a lake house! 

Easy explanation would be they got it *after* that episode in season 3, but continuity errors bother me in shows even though it’s not that serious.

“Political” episodes in S8,"I saw another post here talking about “political” episodes in Season 8. 

If you feel season 8 touched on political topics, can you tell me what those are? I haven’t watched in a few months, but remember racism & police violence being big topics. Racism and police violence are highly politicized, but I wouldn’t call them political issues. They ARE police issues, and it seems silly to me to ignore it in a show set in modern times about policing. 

I’m just curious about this viewpoint, as I’ve never considered those to be “political” episodes… just reflecting the world in which they’re set. Hoping some of you who do feel that way could shed some light on what it is that you don’t like/why you consider it political specifically? 

P.s. I understand if maybe you want a show to “escape” these heavy topics and that’s why you don’t like it being included. But I’m more curious about why it’s labeled as political by some viewers. Not sure if I’m missing something.",,Season 8,8,0.67,,False,True,10,brooklynninenine

Gina & Amy,"So as we all know, Gina is absolutely horrible to Amy. I have seen theories floating around that it's because Gina crushes on Jake. However, does anyone else think it's actually the other way around - Gina crushes on Amy?

She is very weird with Amy's drinking habits (Drink One Amy, Drink Two Amy, etc.), almost as if she's trying to get Amy drunk enough to be into her. And in Season 4, she even offers to teach Amy how to kiss - in a jibe but nonetheless.

For the first time I powered through the NBC seasons.,"6 and 7 were not as bad as I remembered and had their highlights. I enjoyed Debbie more this time around, along with the even more over the top heists. It had a different feel that was a little more raunchy than before.

However this was the first time I watched season 8 and honestly it was perfect. I love how they addressed the changing  landscape of the police department and how everyone dealt with it. I thought Rosa's choices would be weird but to me it showed Rosa growing as a character. It took a hopeful tone that reform is possible and watching these chracter's arcs were finished in a satisfying way.

Just finished the series for the first time.,"I don't know what to do now. I'm just so depressed that it's over. I want to watch more.

At first, I didn't like a few characters, but I really started loving every single character by the end of the series, even Gina, who I see most people hate.

I heard people say the show was different when it went to NBC, but I didn't notice or see any difference. It felt like the same show. The only difference I've seen was that they cussed with a censor, which I kind of like. It was funny. I don't know what people are talking about.

Season 8 was good overall for me. There are only 2 or 3 episodes that felt overly political, and even then, they had some funny moments. I don't like how Rosa left the 99.

I don't like how they portrayed that cops are bad. I know there are a lot of bad cops, but there's still more good than bad. We just see more bad because they get the most attention. I know the system itself is fucked, but there are still genuinely good cops like this show used to portray. I like this show being set in a world without police brutality and showing us the fun antics of being a cop, and showing us good lighthearted fun with being a cop. But I understand why they did portray the real world. I just wish they ignored the real world and showed a more positive side of things.

Jake is my favorite character. He's goofy, immature, and fun, but he's also a kind-hearted, sweet, and caring guy. He's a true sweetheart. I also love his boyish charm; he's always smiling and positive about everything. I just love everything about him.

Jake and Amy's relationship was amazing. I do wish they spent more time together in the early parts of the relationship because their 6-month anniversary came, and they barely had any time actually together. But their relationship overall was handled very well. I'm glad it wasn't a will-they-won't-they, and they didn't get together and break up a billion times. They just got together and stayed together for the rest of the series.

I want them to make more. Peacock would be the perfect place to revive the show or have an annual Halloween heist movie. Either one would work. Maybe the movie would be a lot more feasible and easier to do, but anything to get more of these characters.

I know I can just rewatch this show, but I really want to see what happens next. 😅

I hope in this universe they completely deal with the police brutality issues, and Rosa goes back to work, and Jake does too. I like to think of them working again.

I just think the police brutality thing put a bad taste in my mouth because it makes it seem like these characters are bad for being police and that the show is bad for humanizing them. If people hate cops so much, then every cop should just quit and see how far society can go without cops. (Not completely serious, just trying to make a point.) I just like this show being portrayed as fun and hopeful.

Just finished watching the series for the first time. I’m emotional.,"I’ve watched a number of shows but B99 is so special. Took me 10 days to binge it (don’t ask). But man, I love everything about this show.

I think what stuck out to me most was how great the writing and characters are. The writers did a great job mixing and matching what characters are doing what and with who. Not every episode is perfect, but there rarely — if at all — felt like there were filler episodes. And not every character is perfect…

But the core group of the 99 was fantastic. They were relatable, diverse characters handling real world situations. They formed (what felt like) real relationships. And everyone grew so much from the pilot to the finale.

Jokes never felt forced. Important topics were handled with care. And they always kept you invested.

(Potential spoiler ahead)

Watching Jake transform from an immature guy who only cares about his job to a mature (mostly) husband who gives up his former dream job to be the best father and husband he can be is amazing. It’s not something I would’ve expected at the beginning. But the Jake and Amy (Peraltiago) relationship was handed so beautifully. They made each other better people.

And seeing everyone evolve, especially characters like Rosa and Holt who were once super quiet people and found their emotional side… it’s amazing. That’s why you watch TV — for journeys like this one.

Newly Joined,"Joined this subreddit to see if I can find the love I used to have for this show.

Brief History: Loved the show since day one. I’ve watched every season countless times, bought all the seasons on dvd as and when they were released

Was gutted when it nearly got cancelled, so glad it got picked up by NBC. I was happy with how season 5 ended if it was to be the finale but so psyched it continued.

Noticed that while I enjoyed nbc seasons something felt off but still enjoyed watching it for the most part

Season 8 for me, especially the 1st episode really rubbed me the wrong way and I just look at my season collection with a bitter taste and haven’t watched it since.

Today I saw a post from this community which lead to me reading various quotes and laughing.

I’ve now joined this subreddit hoping I can reignite my love for the show.

A Question About Seamus,"Vague title, but no spoilers.

When Seamus tries to call in the favor from Holt in S5E11, *The Favor*, Seamus tells Holt that he has a recording of their conversation.

It seems like all that was said was that Holt agreed to do Seamus a favor in exchange for information on Hawkins. Isn't this a completely legal tactic that investigators use all the time in order to get information and confessions? I thought the police were allowed, even encouraged, to lie or make false promises in exchange for information.

Obviously it could easily just be plot reasons. Or maybe I just don't understand the legality of these situations. Possibly there is a plot point I'm missing.

I'm on the last 2 episodes of season 6. I'm not ready for this show to end.,"I don't know how to process my feelings with this show about to be over for me but I've grown very attached to it. It's gotten to the point where I don't want to watch anymore episodes because it just brings me closer to the end and it's harder to fully enjoy these episodes knowing it's the end. I know it's silly to care so deeply about a TV show but I just love this show so much.

I know it's extremely unlikely but I wish the show could come back for a few more seasons. Peacock seems like a perfect fit 👀 

I know people are just gonna say rewatch it but it's just not the same as watching it for the first time. I like to see these characters lives further develop and try to solve these cases with them and all that goes away with rewatches. I have this thing where I prefer to see what happens next instead of rewatching and going back to square one. Like I would literally just watch a spinoff of Jake and Amy being a couple lol and then the other characters pop in from time to time. 

I guess I'm just saying, I'm scared to finish the show because I don't want it to end. What makes me even sadder is knowing season 7 is only 13 episode and season 8 is only 10 episodes. If they were both 22 episode seasons than I would feel much better.",,Other,5,0.78,,False,True,5,brooklynninenine

Sooooooo...... Let's discuss what's wrong with Season 8......,"I've just started S8 on Netflix. I watched it when it aired in the UK last year, but I've been rewatching the series again, and now I'm on S8 (but only watching it fully for the 2nd time now) and I wanna discuss with everyone what's wrong with it. Just started it tonight so I'm on S8 ep1 😅

IMO - To begin with, the whole Covid thing and Rosa quitting to become a PI bc of very real outside-of-tv-show-stuff-real-life-situations was a bit much. Nothing wrong with the topics themselves being mentioned in a TV show, but B99 has always been a funny, uplifting series and bringing Covid into it just seemed a bit too real and deep imo. Big things like this are usually mentioned as a little side joke, or as a quick background comment, not as whole real life, real world subjects now affecting characters in a TV show and it being the reason a character in a TV show did 'X' thing bc of 'X' reason. (Not talking about B99 specifically, just big real world stuff, like Covid are not usually full on topics).

Idk, just feels a bit bleh and kinda like, ""oh yeah, we should *probably* find a way to bring the serious issues that have happened in the world, but let's not make whole episodes about it, just bits"".

I just wanna say here that I'm not trying to offend or upset anyone, and I apologise if I have done so whilst you've read this, that was not and is not my intention. I just think there are some things wrong with B99 season 8, and as I'm currently watching the first episode again I remembered when I finished it last year, I felt like there were a lot of weird out-of-context stuff in S8 as a whole. And I thought I'd air my opinions on here, and if anyone has anything else to say about it too then great, if not, that's fine as well.

I love Jake and Amy together but I'm kinda bummed that we don't see much of them interacting when they first got together. I wish they would have spent more time together. I didn't like when they had their 6th month anniversary and I didn't see any of that? It felt like it was just all of a sudden and we didn't see them together that much. Other than that I absolutely love them together. They are so cute. 

I really started loving the other characters in season 2. Everyone is so very different but somehow work well together. I love it.

WHEN THEY WERE THE STUDS OF THE NINE-NINE

In season six, when Jake and Terry are looking into an old case of Hitchcock and Scully's, they make a surprising discovery. Hitchcock and Scully frequently claim that they are - or once were - the studs of the Nine-Nine. Of course, no one believed them or gave any weight to their words, until Jake and Terry found undeniable proof.

They uncover a photograph that depicts Scully and Hitchcock as, well, total hunks. This revelation is both as hilarious as it is shocking, but shows that Hitchcock and Scully were telling the truth all along.",,Discussion,14,0.9,,False,True,27,brooklynninenine

Does Jake ever grow up?,"EDIT: Nevermind y'all, I got to season 3 and seeing Vulture torture Jake has appeased me. I'm definitely keep watching to see him get treated like he deserves.

&#x200B;

I'm in S2 E21 right now and I really dislike Jake as a character. The only reason I kept watching this far is because I like most of the other characters.

I find Jake to be absolutely unbearable due to how he entitled he behaves. He acts as if the world revolves around him and as if he gets to do things however he wants. He acts like the world is his canvas and other people are just mere painting tools that provide content for his entertainment. He disrespects everyone, makes fun of Scully&Hitchcock 24/7 even though they don't like it, disregards all the important rules, acts like he's an authority. Charles being a total sidekick emphasizes Jake's negative actions so much that I'm considering if I should just quit watching at this point.

My questions are:

Does he ever start obeying at least some rules and not frantically do whatever he feels like?

Do Hitchcock&Scully keep getting treated terribly by the squad and being humiliated?

Does Charles grow as a character and become less of a submissive sidekick who acts like he doesn't have a mind of his own?

Is there any moment further in the series where someone calls out Jake seriously for this? An eye-opening experience for him that makes him consider ""Maybe I should grow up a bit""?",,Discussion,0,0.4,,False,True,19,brooklynninenine

What happened to Holt? And a tangent on memories,"Following along my usual ""niche observations"" path.

When Holt and Peralta are taken hostage by Seamus Murphy and Kevin inflicts a coriocolo...copolla.... kokomo injuncture.... Holt and Kevin agree that using Dirtbag as a ""got ya"" is dumb because the dirtbag is a useful part of the vacuum.

HOWEVER! When Holt in his youth catches the Brooklyn Broiler he calls him a.... dirtbag...

So..... What happened? 

We know that Holts always been a stickler for information and properness. But could it be that he was actually a lot looser in his youth and that Kevin kind of got him to be more educated and formal? When he wants to - Holt has MANY of the same Thomas Cruise-isms that Jake has. (Velvet Thunder for instance)

Consider this. EVERY TIME we have a Holt memory flash - its dictated by Holt vis a vis the narrative tool employed. Ie. He recollects, then we cut back. BUT. The Brooklyn Broiler memory is NOT Holt recollecting. Naturally one could suggest that its a bad memory, because whoever remembers it wasn't there - but in the meta narrative - the memory is clearly FROM Holt, but envoked by someone else and THEREFORE I posit that perhaps it is the ONLY true Holt memory, because without him recollecting it and therefore managing the story - it is recounted as it actually is.

And he said Dirtbag. So.... Did Kevin make him this way?

Gina- The Unreformed Irritating Michael Schur Character,"So, I was rewatching the series recently and was thinking about what an oddly unlikeable character Gina Linetti is within the world of the series, which generally tries to make each character fairly broadly appealing. Sure, Rosa, Hitchcock, and Scully are a little too one-dimensional to really care about much but they’re still broadly sympathetic archetypes if kind of ridiculous people. 

I was thinking that one of co-creator Michael Schur’s best qualities as a writer has been his ability to course-correct certain characters that aren’t quite working in the first season. For example, the first season Michael Scott in the US Office is just a little too abrasive and horrible for US comic sensibilities (Carrel also didn’t have the looks to pull off the Basil Fawlty thing of being a horrible man who you still kind of root for). In Parks and Rec, the first season Leslie Knope is similarly a bit “too much” and sort of pathetic in a way that can work for a film (Greta Gerwig in “Frances Ha”) but is just a little too relentless in a TV series. Similar things can be said about Andy Dwyer on that show. “The Good Place” finally hit the spot by casting such an appealing leading actress (Kristen Bell) that she was able to carry off being a terrible person without being constantly cringe-inducing.

What I can’t figure out is why Brooklyn 99 constantly failed to fix Gina Linetti as a character over so many seasons. I assume they saw there was a problem, given that they took many opportunities to sideline the character in various ways or create exterior story-lines for her because she really only worked well with Holt as a pairing. 

To be clear, I don’t think it’s an insufficiency in Chelsea Peretti that made the character fail. I think she does a decent job, all things considered, but the character is such an unpleasant, unredeemable person who never gets her comeuppance, that it particularly grates in the world of Brooklyn 99—by far the most moralistic and wholesome sitcom in the Michael Schur oeuvre. 

I’m curious if others agree with this take though. I realize it seems kind of harsh but it does seem surprising they kept the character in the context of the show that seemed hyper aware of how the audience was perceiving it.",,SPOILER,12,0.69,,False,True,21,brooklynninenine

A thing thats been bugging me when rewatching - is how often the crew seems to stay late or overtime, without overtime pay. In the ""Tattler"" episode, the end of the day rolls around - but Holt, Terry, Scully and Hitchcock all decide to stay to hear the new sound - they do this weirdly saddening - ""He's asleep, my wifes not expecting me,"" thing. Which triggered my memory. 

Because it happens A LOT that they just don't go home. They stay at Holts work hang, they go to Shaws, they just kind of hang around. Jakes workaholism is well established - but the rest of them have lives. Its the thing that threatens Rosa and.... JOCELYN.... Pryce.... and its the whole arc of our Dads and their marriage.

The Taming of Hitchcock,"Okay so. My Bare Lady is actually a film. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My\_Bare\_Lady\_(film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bare_Lady_(film)) \- 

(You can skip these two paragraphs if you don't care about specifics)

its not xxx rated, its just exploitation - which is a genre that kind of comes around in the 70ies and 80is following the legalization of pornography and the veritable ONSLAUGHT of ""edgy cinema"" in the abscense of censorship. I cba to look it up - but I remember that there's a thing about American censorship laws pre-frumpy wives of senators that led to A LOT of directors trying to see how far they could take it.

Exploitation is also grindhouse and the then developing wave of very very violent horror. They had a similar arms race in the Californian corn industry. Essentially the primary reason we have all this hyper sexual but wholesome stuff these days is because of ""free love"" lack of censorship and Tipper Gore being cranky. 

(Now we're at the point)

But thats not the point. The point is that My Bare Lady is a movie about a girl falling in love with a nudist and then doing a reversed My Fair Lady - in which she strips - rather than dresses up. 

So I posit that B99 is being really clever again. By playing off Hitchcocks reference as a joke - but in reality they ARE ""My Bare Lady""ing him - because they are stripping him of the characteristics he uses to defer from doing work or being taken seriously\[1\] (so as to coast until retirement and his sex barge) - so he is actually, in a metaphorical sense, appearing nude before the evaluator, because he is not allowed to do all the things he does, but has to appear - normal.

\[1\] - Hes still a certified creep, but the tactic of seeming useless is something he and Scully developed because they prefer mousing around the old house.

I finally solved the 12 men puzzle! (No solution nor spoilers inside),"I first saw Season 2, Episode 18 in December of last year.  Having had experience with similar riddles/puzzles, when I learned about the Captain's puzzle, I determined to figure it out on my own and not Google it.

Many nights since then, I have fallen asleep thinking over various solutions and rejecting them, as they each had some flaw.  I've spent many hours on this, mostly when I couldn't sleep at night, which is often.  I imagine this is what Holt's character was fictionally doing for many years.

Just now, I laid down for a nap and before falling asleep, I figured it out!  I went over and over the solution in my head, and couldn't find any flaw in it.  I'm so stoked!  Now I guess I'll finally Google and find all the others who surely have found the same solution.  I don't see any other method than the one I came up with.

Anyways, just wanted to share this because the old-fashioned way of doing such puzzles (i.e. not Googling the answer) is still possible, but may take quite some time :-) that was a tough one!

Nikolaj should have been the One True Boyle,"So the 'Boyle isn't a Boyle' storyline gets a lot of pushback. It never sat well with me, but I could never put my finger on why. I think it's because it feels way out of character for Charles to think that Nikolaj would be any less of a Boyle because he was adopted. He describes him as a 'Boyle once removed' and it jars so much with the Boyle we know who is so nurturing and wants his kid to grow up feeling loved and accepted. 

It really feels like the whole storyline could have been saved by having Nikolaj open the Grandmother Dough jar (loosened by Terry I guess?), and then the 'message' of the episode would be that Charles accepts for himself the message he's been telling Nikolaj all along - that family is more than just biology or DNA, and that not being biologically related to the rest of the Boyle clan doesn't mean that he's any less of a Boyle.",,Season 8,215,0.95,,False,True,15,brooklynninenine

Anyone else noticed the similarities betwixt B99 and Space Precinct (1994)?,"The characters have so many parallels:


Jack Haldane - Jake Peralta
- Both proud New York trained cops
- Will they won’t they with the sassy female detective
- Childish arrogance, but loveable and kind

Jane Castle - Amy Santiago
- No nonsense and career focused
- Very smart
- Acts like she doesn’t like Jack/ Jake but gets jealous when he dates someone else

Rexton Podly - Raymond Holt
- Captains who take their jobs seriously
- Can get cross at their team being silly
- Have to deal with prejudice (as a Creon alien from the wrong side of the tracks/ a black and gay officer)

Patrick Brogan - Terry Jeffords
- Smart and earnest detective 
- Physically and intellectually strong 
- Hates corruption
- Protective of his family, who sometimes suffer from his role as police

Silas Romek and Hubble Orrin - Hitchcock and Scully
- Best friends
- Goofy and not great at police work
- Kinda lazy and focused on hedonism
- But ultimately good guys when push comes to shove

Slomo the Robot -Charles Boyle
- People pleasers
- Love cooking and offering food
- Don’t always understand human language and customs 

Aurelia Took - Gina Linetti 
- Wisecracking
- Almost dies and everyone worries - but low-key immortal
- Telepathic
- Gina is interested in astronomy, possibly from another species or planet? Aurelia is a Tarn from planet Zimble

Charles gets a new food rival at work. Everyone loves her home made pies and fresh desserts, especially hitch cock and scully, but Boyle suspects that her cooking isnt from scratch as she boasts and sets up a one man sting to catch her. Instead he catches her in a liaison with a wanted fugitive and wrestles the entire episode with whether or not to turn her in and risk being labelled ""that guy"" at work. The one who tattled on a coworker because they were better at something. In the end he does report her and the fugitive is captured. In the mayhem of the arrest Charles finds boxes of premade cake mix and screams ""I KNEW IT!"" as Jake and Rosa wrestle with the suspect.

Peeves,"I have watched this show way too much that I've actually been able to say the lines at the same time as the characters (My brain is pop pop popping like an aneurysm) so I can't remember what the word is to describe the above lol.

But the point of my post is annoying little things I'm picking up through every rewatch.

1. Terry is always hangry. Every time Terry gets upset he sounds like a whiny deep-voiced baby and I’m starting to get annoyed with it lol.

2. Holt used to be all proper words and no abbreviations and no contractions or slang words but now he says things like pwned.

3. Amy was always ready for anything and binder this and binder that and so put together but once the baby comes (It’s cute that Mac is actually Axel Fumero, Melissa Fumero’s real son!!!) she becomes pretty crazy and not put together at all... I know it's hard being a parent but just that big change is blegh.

4. Hitchcock always being super disgusting and barely ever serious, I didn’t mind it for a while but the more I watch the show I hate how much he says the word cuck or cucks and the episode where the squad finds out that Holt is compromised and says it’s my responsibility and Jake says it’s his responsibility to and then the everyone on the team says and mine until Hitchcock where he says “Six people seems like a lot. I mean, at some point, it's just too many cooks. And mine.” I know this is a comedy show but idk it just kind of irks me.

There are many more I’m sure but that’s all I can think of right now. Apologies if this doesn’t make sense I’m pretty much just rambling at the moment and I’m semi-high from pain medication lol

Anyone else have any peeves?

Peacock loads up… 

Jake has a mask on. Alright, I can cope with that… not awful but whatever.

Rosas quitting. WHAT! Ugh. My favorite character! She’ll probably still be around, but I’ll miss Jake and Rosa.

Amy’s welcoming party. Sigh. That’s what did it. I love how they addressed these situations at least, but I didn’t think that would be the premise of the episode. I like watching shows to escape reality. I understand it was probably difficult to make a cop show based in NYC during 2020, so they had to address it somehow, but a whole episode…

Next episode comes on, thank god they are done with that. Nice break. Cute episode too! Kevin and Holt for life.

"Lawyers of the B99 subreddit, I need help settling an argument that google could not answer.","Okay so myself and the lady friend got into an argument while watching the end of the Fugitive Part 1 (S4, E11). As you are on this subreddit have probably seen the episode and know the plot, so I won’t reiterate. The argument stems from them finding what they thought was the last fugitive. I argue that Jake won that bet fair and square as if you watch the scene he CLEARLY saw the dude first, and the guy immediately gave himself up, the lady friend says that Santiago won through her actually stating the full Miranda rights.

My opinion is that as the person is a, “fugitive” (which we learn the person was not actually a fugitive but a hostage of sorts as Jeudy’s foster brother forced him into changing clothes, etc., but at the time of apprehension, that was not known to any of the officers), the Miranda rights are completely moot as the person is already incarcerated and is on the run from the law. At the time of the arrest for whatever sentence he was serving he was definitely read his rights, and I maintain they do not need to be read again before him being officially caught/apprehended/arrested/whatever term you want to use.

Times when B99 became CINEMA,"So Im abit of a sucker for cinema and I tend to gravitate towards shows that care about craftsmanship. I feel like B99 has some episodes that are so...... like they transcend being ""Funny cop drama"" and become really amazingly dramatic episodes that actually have a huge impact on you.

Show me going - really springs to mind as an episode that effectively takes the actual work of policing and shows how sometimes, its intensely dangerous. The tense feel of it, only following Rosa through radio chatter. The reverence they had towards portraying it as it is. It was a really bold move and the episode is so so intense. 

I forget its name. But the one with the dentist. Its really funny. Holt raging about doctorates for instance. But its such a well crafted episode and it does a really great job of making light of something serious. I believe parts of it is a subtle nod to an absurdly great scene from Andrew Braughers former cop show, in which he is forced to frame a kid for murder. You can find it on Youtube, its intense.

All in all I think B99 is a better show than most. Because it manages to be Andy Sambergs comedic vehicle, but also actually takes great care to objectively portray police work - the cost and its problems. I know its divisive, but the ""One of the good ones"" episode really hit me, its not full on, but its another example of how they did some things to be true to the subject matter, while also making jokes.

I started on February 3rd, binge-watched a lot and finished the 8th season few moments ago.

There will be nothing particularly meaningful in my post - I just felt the need to share my emotions here.

I don't know what is it but there's something in B99 that I haven't found in any other TV series, even though there are plenty who I enjoy. I laughed on some other series, I cried on some as well. But I never before felt so ""connected"" to the show as I did with Brooklyn 99.

It became a part of me so much that I feel empty now that I watched it all. So the one thing that will keep me alive is the thought that I can always start watching it again - be it the whole series or some single episodes.

Now that I watched it all I should be able to get every reference somebody makes to B99 and understand the context of every meme that I'll stumble upon here or elsewhere.

Yes, the title sort of says it all. I have watched many clips of the show, loved them all, but remember starting the pilot episode and just couldn't finish it. It is my belief that, like most shows, the first season the writers and producers are trying to find their footing - so it isn't quite cooking with gas but I want to start there and go back to the first season.

With that in mind, which season and/or episode would you recommend as a first viewing for someone getting into the show?

I know the stance the show was trying to make, and Keri seems to be fine with it.

I have asked friends, most of them support the show’s stance and said that taking the money makes you culpable in letting the perpetrators go and of any future harm they cause.

Why didnt holt use the wuntch blackmail??,"
In season 2 wuntch planted a guy from internal affairs to snoop on the 99 and their task force.

Holt told them to leave the precinct alone or else she would be “wuntch meat” ☠️ which I’m guessing everyone assumed he meant that he would show the recording to her bosses and get her fired. There are multiple occasions where holt could’ve used it on wuntch when she was trying to ruin his career Eg he could’ve used it when she promoted him to the public relations office And Another example is when she demoted him to a police officer (which was techinically fair because he hadn’t spent a full year as a uniformed officer as required but he still could’ve used that blackmail). there was never really a clear answer since it was never brought up again.

Jake/Amy for sure, given one of them decided to leave after S5, one would also have to follow, the divorce/split wouldn’t go down well. Amy&Jonah in Superstore fell victims to the lazy split writing. I just can’t think of a plausible reason for them to of still kept one character in the show when the other had gone

I feel like Holt too, maybe Terry/Rosa especially since they had hard hitting / rep with them like Rosa’s and Holt’s sexuality",,Discussion,6,0.88,,False,True,4,brooklynninenine
