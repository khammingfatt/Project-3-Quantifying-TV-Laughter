100,"“The Good Ones” is a good episode in my opinion [This is my first time watching from the beginning of season 6]

I found the episode incredibly cathartic and enjoyable because of the self-awareness it took a cop show, let alone a comedy programme, to acknowledge and address the profound problems in policing in the United States. 

The sub-plot with Charles was funny (to me), and the main plot line, with the female captain running through why they can’t fire two police officers for assaulting that woman needs to be known by more people. 

Honestly I knew this episode was coming thanks to its clear lowest ranking on all the rating infographics and all the references to “a political episode” in comments on here; but having a black man murdered on camera by a police officer, and a literal attempted coup trying to overthrow an election meant that the writers couldn’t simply continue with their cop based programme.

133,"How is it that Holt wasn’t able to understand Monty Hall? I get the whole „Boooone“ thing, but someone as smart and knowledgeable as Holt shouldn’t have an issue with a statistics problem people learn and solve in 9th grade.

EDIT: To understand it, think about it like this (assuming you are familiar with the general concept):

„If your initial guess is wrong, you always win by switching. You initial guess is wrong 2/3 of the time“

EDIT NO. 2: Here’s my best long form explanation:

Let‘s say each door gets a letter, A, B and C. A and B are wrong, C is right, but you don’t know it, the show host obviously does, after your first pick he opens a wrong door you didn’t also pick.

1. 

So your first pick is A, the host therefore can only open B, as A is your choice and C is the right door. 

After that, you switch, your only option for that is C, the right one, and you win.

2.

Same goes for B as your initial guess. Show host has to open A. You switch to C, again your only option if you switch. You win again.

3.

Only when you pick C, the host can decide to opens A or B, if you switch to the one he didn’t open, you lose.


So if you always switch, there are two initial choices where you win, only one initial choice where you lose.

So if your initial choice is wrong, you automatically win by switching. Only if your initial choice is right you lose by switching.

And your initial choice is wrong 2/3 times due to the 3 doors. So if you switch you win 2/3 rounds.",brooklynninenine

So, here is my take on it.

&gt;!Amy was 100% right in the Casecation episode. The only reason she gave an ultimatum was justified, because, as she says, as a woman, she might not be fully fertile 2 years down the line. So, if two years later, Jake still wouldn't come around, no loss for him. But, for her, she would have to find someone else, get married and then have a baby and it might be years before that. She fought for what she wanted. That's it.!&lt;

&gt;!Jake was never manipulated. The bomb scare made him want to have a baby of his own. He came to the decision of his own accord. Nothing on Amy here. !&lt;

&gt;!As for him giving up his police career, there was no ""sacrifice"" there. One of them had to stop working to take care of the baby. Obviously, it will be the one who has progressed less in their career that will have to give it up. Amy was already a Sergeant and well on the path to become Captain or take her police reforms into greater heights. Jake was still a detective and not even written the Sergeant's exam. It is obvious that Jake would be the one who stops his career.!&lt; He was 100% right in his decisions as well.

- The B99 gang has dealt with a myriad of suspects and cases all with varying circumstances, backgrounds and evidence
- How do two veteran detectives (one of them  arguably one of the best in the precinct itself) immediately dismiss this guy as a criminal SOLELY because of his age and looks?
- I know this has happened once before (Neighbourhood watch superman version 0.5) but this pissed me off on how Amy and Rosa call out Charles' detective skills without a second thought
- Charles literally said he found the robber which I assume means he acquired the necessary evidence and witnesses to corroborate his arrest (Charles has been shown to be patient and methodical THROUGHOUT the series) 
- What makes this ""suck salad"" even more suckier is that Rosa and Amy THEN go test the bills the old man gave them in order to check out Charles' claim ONLY AFTER he stood his ground about how he is a good cop. - There was no need to go validate Charles' work when HE ALREADY presumably spent copious amounts of time figuring this out
- I feel this was not only a slight to Charles as a good detective but also showed how narrow-minded Amy and Rosa were IN THIS EPISODE (they are usually very insightful, intelligent and thoughtful)

up until that point everything is fine THEN

four episodes later we get to the heist episode on cinco de mayo, **10 days before** paraltiago's anniversary, in which they refer to the 2017 halloween heist as their last one, reiterating how the 2018 one had to be canceled (irony haha) due to the explosion.

obviously there's no way a whole year passed in four episodes, and it was also not a flashback since we have the lieutenant budget deal with terry, so it's undoubtedly an error.

1. Has Amy ever had sex with Teddy during the rest of her life after Season 2? 

2. Wanted to do so? 

3. Will she ever during the rest of her life after Season 8? 

4. Has Amy ever been romantically with Teddy during the rest of her life after Season 2?

9. Does Amy think Teddy was better romantically or sexually? 

10. Any feelings for Teddy still there in S8?

12. Does Amy see Jake as replaceable to any degree?

14. Does Amy wish Jake would be ""gone"" so she could be romantic or sexual with someone else?

In season 3 episode 23, Captain Holt says “for the last time - not all grown-ups *have* lake houses,” which heavily implies that he does not have a lake house. If he did, that is a place the NYPD doesn’t know about where they can go, which is why Jake suggests it in the first place. Then all of a sudden in season 8, he and Kevin *have* a lake house!

If you feel season 8 touched on political topics, can you tell me what those are? I haven’t watched in a few months, but remember racism &amp; police violence being big topics. Racism and police violence are highly politicized, but I wouldn’t call them political issues. They ARE police issues, and it seems silly to me to ignore it in a show set in modern times about policing. 

I’m just curious about this viewpoint, as I’ve never considered those to be “political” episodes… just reflecting the world in which they’re set. Hoping some of you who do feel that way could shed some light on what it is that you don’t like/why you consider it political specifically? 

P.s. I understand if maybe you want a show to “escape” these heavy topics and that’s why you don’t like it being included. But I’m more curious about why it’s labeled as political by some viewers. Not sure if I’m missing something.",brooklynninenine

However this was the first time I watched season 8 and honestly it was perfect. I love how they addressed the changing  landscape of the police department and how everyone dealt with it. I thought Rosa's choices would be weird but to me it showed Rosa growing as a character. It took a hopeful tone that reform is possible and watching these chracter's arcs were finished in a satisfying way.

263,"Just finished the series for the first time. I don't know what to do now. I'm just so depressed that it's over. I want to watch more.

At first, I didn't like a few characters, but I really started loving every single character by the end of the series, even Gina, who I see most people hate.

I heard people say the show was different when it went to NBC, but I didn't notice or see any difference. It felt like the same show. The only difference I've seen was that they cussed with a censor, which I kind of like. It was funny. I don't know what people are talking about.

Season 8 was good overall for me. There are only 2 or 3 episodes that felt overly political, and even then, they had some funny moments. I don't like how Rosa left the 99.

I don't like how they portrayed that cops are bad. I know there are a lot of bad cops, but there's still more good than bad. We just see more bad because they get the most attention. I know the system itself is fucked, but there are still genuinely good cops like this show used to portray. I like this show being set in a world without police brutality and showing us the fun antics of being a cop, and showing us good lighthearted fun with being a cop. But I understand why they did portray the real world. I just wish they ignored the real world and showed a more positive side of things.

Jake is my favorite character. He's goofy, immature, and fun, but he's also a kind-hearted, sweet, and caring guy. He's a true sweetheart. I also love his boyish charm; he's always smiling and positive about everything. I just love everything about him.

Jake and Amy's relationship was amazing. I do wish they spent more time together in the early parts of the relationship because their 6-month anniversary came, and they barely had any time actually together. But their relationship overall was handled very well. I'm glad it wasn't a will-they-won't-they, and they didn't get together and break up a billion times. They just got together and stayed together for the rest of the series.

I want them to make more. Peacock would be the perfect place to revive the show or have an annual Halloween heist movie. Either one would work. Maybe the movie would be a lot more feasible and easier to do, but anything to get more of these characters.

I know I can just rewatch this show, but I really want to see what happens next. 😅

I hope in this universe they completely deal with the police brutality issues, and Rosa goes back to work, and Jake does too. I like to think of them working again.

I just think the police brutality thing put a bad taste in my mouth because it makes it seem like these characters are bad for being police and that the show is bad for humanizing them. If people hate cops so much, then every cop should just quit and see how far society can go without cops. (Not completely serious, just trying to make a point.) I just like this show being portrayed as fun and hopeful.

This is one of my favorite comedies now. I hope Peacock orders more episodes or a movie one day. They could do what Psych does and give us movies.",brooklynninenine

NOTE - I am not requesting any input on my parenting.  Are there episodes that specifically reference Santa or the Tooth Fairy etc being fake?

326,"Just finished watching the series for the first time. I’m emotional. I’ve watched a number of shows but B99 is so special. Took me 10 days to binge it (don’t ask). But man, I love everything about this show.

I think what stuck out to me most was how great the writing and characters are. The writers did a great job mixing and matching what characters are doing what and with who. Not every episode is perfect, but there rarely — if at all — felt like there were filler episodes. And not every character is perfect…

But the core group of the 99 was fantastic. They were relatable, diverse characters handling real world situations. They formed (what felt like) real relationships. And everyone grew so much from the pilot to the finale.

Jokes never felt forced. Important topics were handled with care. And they always kept you invested.

(Potential spoiler ahead)

Watching Jake transform from an immature guy who only cares about his job to a mature (mostly) husband who gives up his former dream job to be the best father and husband he can be is amazing. It’s not something I would’ve expected at the beginning. But the Jake and Amy (Peraltiago) relationship was handed so beautifully. They made each other better people.

And seeing everyone evolve, especially characters like Rosa and Holt who were once super quiet people and found their emotional side… it’s amazing. That’s why you watch TV — for journeys like this one.

Brief History: Loved the show since day one. I’ve watched every season countless times, bought all the seasons on dvd as and when they were released

Was gutted when it nearly got cancelled, so glad it got picked up by NBC. I was happy with how season 5 ended if it was to be the finale but so psyched it continued.

Noticed that while I enjoyed nbc seasons something felt off but still enjoyed watching it for the most part

Season 8 for me, especially the 1st episode really rubbed me the wrong way and I just look at my season collection with a bitter taste and haven’t watched it since.

When Seamus tries to call in the favor from Holt in S5E11, *The Favor*, Seamus tells Holt that he has a recording of their conversation.

It seems like all that was said was that Holt agreed to do Seamus a favor in exchange for information on Hawkins. Isn't this a completely legal tactic that investigators use all the time in order to get information and confessions? I thought the police were allowed, even encouraged, to lie or make false promises in exchange for information.

It's gotten to the point where I don't want to watch anymore episodes because it just brings me closer to the end and it's harder to fully enjoy these episodes knowing it's the end. I know it's silly to care so deeply about a TV show but I just love this show so much.

I know it's extremely unlikely but I wish the show could come back for a few more seasons. Peacock seems like a perfect fit 👀 

I know people are just gonna say rewatch it but it's just not the same as watching it for the first time.

I have this thing where I prefer to see what happens next instead of rewatching and going back to square one.

392,"Sooooooo...... Let's discuss what's wrong with Season 8...... I've just started S8 on Netflix. I watched it when it aired in the UK last year, but I've been rewatching the series again, and now I'm on S8 (but only watching it fully for the 2nd time now) and I wanna discuss with everyone what's wrong with it. Just started it tonight so I'm on S8 ep1 😅

IMO - To begin with, the whole Covid thing and Rosa quitting to become a PI bc of very real outside-of-tv-show-stuff-real-life-situations was a bit much. Nothing wrong with the topics themselves being mentioned in a TV show, but B99 has always been a funny, uplifting series and bringing Covid into it just seemed a bit too real and deep imo. Big things like this are usually mentioned as a little side joke, or as a quick background comment, not as whole real life, real world subjects now affecting characters in a TV show and it being the reason a character in a TV show did 'X' thing bc of 'X' reason. (Not talking about B99 specifically, just big real world stuff, like Covid are not usually full on topics).

Idk, just feels a bit bleh and kinda like, ""oh yeah, we should *probably* find a way to bring the serious issues that have happened in the world, but let's not make whole episodes about it, just bits"".

I just wanna say here that I'm not trying to offend or upset anyone, and I apologise if I have done so whilst you've read this, that was not and is not my intention. I just think there are some things wrong with B99 season 8, and as I'm currently watching the first episode again I remembered when I finished it last year, I felt like there were a lot of weird out-of-context stuff in S8 as a whole. And I thought I'd air my opinions on here, and if anyone has anything else to say about it too then great, if not, that's fine as well.

I didn't really care about any of the characters except for Jake for the first season. Mostly bc he's so adorable and cute and I love how he's always smiling and positive about everything. Hes like a child but in the good way where he always sees the positive in things and very optimistic. 

I love Jake and Amy together but I'm kinda bummed that we don't see much of them interacting when they first got together. I wish they would have spent more time together. I didn't like when they had their 6th month anniversary and I didn't see any of that? It felt like it was just all of a sudden and we didn't see them together that much.

Guess Terry has the best set up for being the Punisher with his family and all but I feel like he would just eat all his grief away. Same with Jake and Amy. Hitchcock, Skully and Boyle would not have it in them to become The Punisher and Gina, doesn't really seem the type but who knows, she might surprise everyone and turn out to he a murderous psychopath with a penitent for killing criminals in really brutal yet creative ways.

WHEN THEY WERE THE STUDS OF THE NINE-NINE

In season six, when Jake and Terry are looking into an old case of Hitchcock and Scully's, they make a surprising discovery. Hitchcock and Scully frequently claim that they are - or once were - the studs of the Nine-Nine. Of course, no one believed them or gave any weight to their words, until Jake and Terry found undeniable proof.

They uncover a photograph that depicts Scully and Hitchcock as, well, total hunks. This revelation is both as hilarious as it is shocking, but shows that Hitchcock and Scully were telling the truth all along.",brooklynninenine

Just watched The Party for about the 5th time and first there is the scene where they are returning all the items Gina stole from Kevin and Raymond's house, and in response to one item Holt just says very quickly ""this isn't ours"" but they move on straight away.

But the best bit I only just noticed is when Scully starts to sing and Hitchcock gets emotional, as the rest of the 99 walk out of the restaurant Jake puts his arm around Hitchcock's shoulder, Hitchock puts his arm around Jake's waist.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in S2 E21 right now and I really dislike Jake as a character. The only reason I kept watching this far is because I like most of the other characters.

I find Jake to be absolutely unbearable due to how he entitled he behaves. He acts as if the world revolves around him and as if he gets to do things however he wants. He acts like the world is his canvas and other people are just mere painting tools that provide content for his entertainment. He disrespects everyone, makes fun of Scully&amp;Hitchcock 24/7 even though they don't like it, disregards all the important rules, acts like he's an authority. Charles being a total sidekick emphasizes Jake's negative actions so much that I'm considering if I should just quit watching at this point.

My questions are:

Does he ever start obeying at least some rules and not frantically do whatever he feels like?

Do Hitchcock&amp;Scully keep getting treated terribly by the squad and being humiliated?

Does Charles grow as a character and become less of a submissive sidekick who acts like he doesn't have a mind of his own?

Is there any moment further in the series where someone calls out Jake seriously for this? An eye-opening experience for him that makes him consider ""Maybe I should grow up a bit""?",brooklynninenine

543,"What happened to Holt? And a tangent on memories Following along my usual ""niche observations"" path.

When Holt and Peralta are taken hostage by Seamus Murphy and Kevin inflicts a coriocolo...copolla.... kokomo injuncture.... Holt and Kevin agree that using Dirtbag as a ""got ya"" is dumb because the dirtbag is a useful part of the vacuum.

HOWEVER! When Holt in his youth catches the Brooklyn Broiler he calls him a.... dirtbag...

So..... What happened? 

We know that Holts always been a stickler for information and properness. But could it be that he was actually a lot looser in his youth and that Kevin kind of got him to be more educated and formal? When he wants to - Holt has MANY of the same Thomas Cruise-isms that Jake has. (Velvet Thunder for instance)

Consider this. EVERY TIME we have a Holt memory flash - its dictated by Holt vis a vis the narrative tool employed. Ie. He recollects, then we cut back. BUT. The Brooklyn Broiler memory is NOT Holt recollecting. Naturally one could suggest that its a bad memory, because whoever remembers it wasn't there - but in the meta narrative - the memory is clearly FROM Holt, but envoked by someone else and THEREFORE I posit that perhaps it is the ONLY true Holt memory, because without him recollecting it and therefore managing the story - it is recounted as it actually is.

And he said Dirtbag. So.... Did Kevin make him this way?

We all know Jake is irresponsible, but I just like how it seems as if he lost his old controllers and now has the new ones.

567,"Gina- The Unreformed Irritating Michael Schur Character So, I was rewatching the series recently and was thinking about what an oddly unlikeable character Gina Linetti is within the world of the series, which generally tries to make each character fairly broadly appealing. Sure, Rosa, Hitchcock, and Scully are a little too one-dimensional to really care about much but they’re still broadly sympathetic archetypes if kind of ridiculous people. 

I was thinking that one of co-creator Michael Schur’s best qualities as a writer has been his ability to course-correct certain characters that aren’t quite working in the first season. For example, the first season Michael Scott in the US Office is just a little too abrasive and horrible for US comic sensibilities (Carrel also didn’t have the looks to pull off the Basil Fawlty thing of being a horrible man who you still kind of root for). In Parks and Rec, the first season Leslie Knope is similarly a bit “too much” and sort of pathetic in a way that can work for a film (Greta Gerwig in “Frances Ha”) but is just a little too relentless in a TV series. Similar things can be said about Andy Dwyer on that show. “The Good Place” finally hit the spot by casting such an appealing leading actress (Kristen Bell) that she was able to carry off being a terrible person without being constantly cringe-inducing.

What I can’t figure out is why Brooklyn 99 constantly failed to fix Gina Linetti as a character over so many seasons. I assume they saw there was a problem, given that they took many opportunities to sideline the character in various ways or create exterior story-lines for her because she really only worked well with Holt as a pairing. 

To be clear, I don’t think it’s an insufficiency in Chelsea Peretti that made the character fail. I think she does a decent job, all things considered, but the character is such an unpleasant, unredeemable person who never gets her comeuppance, that it particularly grates in the world of Brooklyn 99—by far the most moralistic and wholesome sitcom in the Michael Schur oeuvre. 

I’m curious if others agree with this take though. I realize it seems kind of harsh but it does seem surprising they kept the character in the context of the show that seemed hyper aware of how the audience was perceiving it.",brooklynninenine

571,"Everyone has FOMAU at the 99 (questions on American work culture) So.

A thing thats been bugging me when rewatching - is how often the crew seems to stay late or overtime, without overtime pay. In the ""Tattler"" episode, the end of the day rolls around - but Holt, Terry, Scully and Hitchcock all decide to stay to hear the new sound - they do this weirdly saddening - ""He's asleep, my wifes not expecting me,"" thing. Which triggered my memory. 

Because it happens A LOT that they just don't go home. They stay at Holts work hang, they go to Shaws, they just kind of hang around. Jakes workaholism is well established - but the rest of them have lives. Its the thing that threatens Rosa and.... JOCELYN.... Pryce.... and its the whole arc of our Dads and their marriage.

It's a very little thing and they obviously added it for humour and fun, but Rosa is a badass and they're all so scared of her, and she's done so many acrobatic things throughout the series until that point, it just seems weird that they very confidently thought she couldn't do one. A handstand seems like something Rosa learnt in middle school because she got hurt in the legs and couldn't walk and was too proud to take any kind of help so just started walking on her hands everywhere. No way they all thought otherwise. If the creators just wanted to show off her handstand, they could've found so many other opportunities.",brooklynninenine

581,"The Taming of Hitchcock Okay so. My Bare Lady is actually a film. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My\_Bare\_Lady\_(film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Bare_Lady_(film)) \- 

(You can skip these two paragraphs if you don't care about specifics)

its not xxx rated, its just exploitation - which is a genre that kind of comes around in the 70ies and 80is following the legalization of pornography and the veritable ONSLAUGHT of ""edgy cinema"" in the abscense of censorship. I cba to look it up - but I remember that there's a thing about American censorship laws pre-frumpy wives of senators that led to A LOT of directors trying to see how far they could take it.

Exploitation is also grindhouse and the then developing wave of very very violent horror. They had a similar arms race in the Californian corn industry. Essentially the primary reason we have all this hyper sexual but wholesome stuff these days is because of ""free love"" lack of censorship and Tipper Gore being cranky. 

(Now we're at the point)

But thats not the point. The point is that My Bare Lady is a movie about a girl falling in love with a nudist and then doing a reversed My Fair Lady - in which she strips - rather than dresses up. 

So I posit that B99 is being really clever again. By playing off Hitchcocks reference as a joke - but in reality they ARE ""My Bare Lady""ing him - because they are stripping him of the characteristics he uses to defer from doing work or being taken seriously\[1\] (so as to coast until retirement and his sex barge) - so he is actually, in a metaphorical sense, appearing nude before the evaluator, because he is not allowed to do all the things he does, but has to appear - normal.

\[1\] - Hes still a certified creep, but the tactic of seeming useless is something he and Scully developed because they prefer mousing around the old house.

Many nights since then, I have fallen asleep thinking over various solutions and rejecting them, as they each had some flaw.  I've spent many hours on this, mostly when I couldn't sleep at night, which is often.  I imagine this is what Holt's character was fictionally doing for many years.

Just now, I laid down for a nap and before falling asleep, I figured it out!  I went over and over the solution in my head, and couldn't find any flaw in it.  I'm so stoked!  Now I guess I'll finally Google and find all the others who surely have found the same solution.  I don't see any other method than the one I came up with.

Anyways, just wanted to share this because the old-fashioned way of doing such puzzles (i.e. not Googling the answer) is still possible, but may take quite some time :-) that was a tough one!

628,"Nikolaj should have been the One True Boyle So the 'Boyle isn't a Boyle' storyline gets a lot of pushback. It never sat well with me, but I could never put my finger on why. I think it's because it feels way out of character for Charles to think that Nikolaj would be any less of a Boyle because he was adopted. He describes him as a 'Boyle once removed' and it jars so much with the Boyle we know who is so nurturing and wants his kid to grow up feeling loved and accepted. 

It really feels like the whole storyline could have been saved by having Nikolaj open the Grandmother Dough jar (loosened by Terry I guess?), and then the 'message' of the episode would be that Charles accepts for himself the message he's been telling Nikolaj all along - that family is more than just biology or DNA, and that not being biologically related to the rest of the Boyle clan doesn't mean that he's any less of a Boyle.",brooklynninenine

Jane Castle - Amy Santiago
- No nonsense and career focused
- Very smart
- Acts like she doesn’t like Jack/ Jake but gets jealous when he dates someone else

Rexton Podly - Raymond Holt
- Captains who take their jobs seriously
- Can get cross at their team being silly
- Have to deal with prejudice (as a Creon alien from the wrong side of the tracks/ a black and gay officer)

Patrick Brogan - Terry Jeffords
- Smart and earnest detective 
- Physically and intellectually strong 
- Hates corruption
- Protective of his family, who sometimes suffer from his role as police

Silas Romek and Hubble Orrin - Hitchcock and Scully
- Best friends
- Goofy and not great at police work
- Kinda lazy and focused on hedonism
- But ultimately good guys when push comes to shove

Slomo the Robot -Charles Boyle
- People pleasers
- Love cooking and offering food
- Don’t always understand human language and customs 

Aurelia Took - Gina Linetti 
- Wisecracking
- Almost dies and everyone worries - but low-key immortal
- Telepathic

659,"Peeves I have watched this show way too much that I've actually been able to say the lines at the same time as the characters (My brain is pop pop popping like an aneurysm) so I can't remember what the word is to describe the above lol.

But the point of my post is annoying little things I'm picking up through every rewatch.

1. Terry is always hangry. Every time Terry gets upset he sounds like a whiny deep-voiced baby and I’m starting to get annoyed with it lol.

2. Holt used to be all proper words and no abbreviations and no contractions or slang words but now he says things like pwned.

3. Amy was always ready for anything and binder this and binder that and so put together but once the baby comes (It’s cute that Mac is actually Axel Fumero, Melissa Fumero’s real son!!!) she becomes pretty crazy and not put together at all... I know it's hard being a parent but just that big change is blegh.

4. Hitchcock always being super disgusting and barely ever serious, I didn’t mind it for a while but the more I watch the show I hate how much he says the word cuck or cucks and the episode where the squad finds out that Holt is compromised and says it’s my responsibility and Jake says it’s his responsibility to and then the everyone on the team says and mine until Hitchcock where he says “Six people seems like a lot. I mean, at some point, it's just too many cooks. And mine.” I know this is a comedy show but idk it just kind of irks me.

There are many more I’m sure but that’s all I can think of right now. Apologies if this doesn’t make sense I’m pretty much just rambling at the moment and I’m semi-high from pain medication lol

Anyone else have any peeves?

ETA: GINA!! I really really hate how Gina treats Amy. Treats her like crap through the whole show. I also don't think she had a really good character arc as she was consistently a jerk (Eat a jerk, Pal) or thinks she's top shit.  I even thought this when I first watched the show but never said it because apparently, people love her so much 😒

His other lines include:

""Be brave bro. Be brave.""

And just for good measure, a very simple...

""Bup, bup, bup"" when he interrupts Terry.

Well played, Jake. Well played.

Boyle also says ""Beautiful"". And then there's people's one word responsed after Boyle gets a strike that are also 'B' words.

Other than Terry's interjection at the beginning, every word in the whole segment starts with 'B'.

I'm guessing that for some people this may have been obvious. But I've seen the episode countless times and never noticed it. So, for everyone as oblivious as me... you're welcome.

Jake has a mask on. Alright, I can cope with that… not awful but whatever.

Rosas quitting. WHAT! Ugh. My favorite character! She’ll probably still be around, but I’ll miss Jake and Rosa.

Amy’s welcoming party. Sigh. That’s what did it. I love how they addressed these situations at least, but I didn’t think that would be the premise of the episode. I like watching shows to escape reality. I understand it was probably difficult to make a cop show based in NYC during 2020, so they had to address it somehow, but a whole episode…

Okay so myself and the lady friend got into an argument while watching the end of the Fugitive Part 1 (S4, E11). As you are on this subreddit have probably seen the episode and know the plot, so I won’t reiterate. The argument stems from them finding what they thought was the last fugitive. I argue that Jake won that bet fair and square as if you watch the scene he CLEARLY saw the dude first, and the guy immediately gave himself up, the lady friend says that Santiago won through her actually stating the full Miranda rights.

My opinion is that as the person is a, “fugitive” (which we learn the person was not actually a fugitive but a hostage of sorts as Jeudy’s foster brother forced him into changing clothes, etc., but at the time of apprehension, that was not known to any of the officers), the Miranda rights are completely moot as the person is already incarcerated and is on the run from the law. At the time of the arrest for whatever sentence he was serving he was definitely read his rights, and I maintain they do not need to be read again before him being officially caught/apprehended/arrested/whatever term you want to use.

811,"Times when B99 became CINEMA So Im abit of a sucker for cinema and I tend to gravitate towards shows that care about craftsmanship. I feel like B99 has some episodes that are so...... like they transcend being ""Funny cop drama"" and become really amazingly dramatic episodes that actually have a huge impact on you.

Show me going - really springs to mind as an episode that effectively takes the actual work of policing and shows how sometimes, its intensely dangerous. The tense feel of it, only following Rosa through radio chatter. The reverence they had towards portraying it as it is. It was a really bold move and the episode is so so intense. 

I forget its name. But the one with the dentist. Its really funny. Holt raging about doctorates for instance. But its such a well crafted episode and it does a really great job of making light of something serious. I believe parts of it is a subtle nod to an absurdly great scene from Andrew Braughers former cop show, in which he is forced to frame a kid for murder. You can find it on Youtube, its intense.

All in all I think B99 is a better show than most. Because it manages to be Andy Sambergs comedic vehicle, but also actually takes great care to objectively portray police work - the cost and its problems. I know its divisive, but the ""One of the good ones"" episode really hit me, its not full on, but its another example of how they did some things to be true to the subject matter, while also making jokes.

I started on February 3rd, binge-watched a lot and finished the 8th season few moments ago.

There will be nothing particularly meaningful in my post - I just felt the need to share my emotions here.

I don't know what is it but there's something in B99 that I haven't found in any other TV series, even though there are plenty who I enjoy. I laughed on some other series, I cried on some as well. But I never before felt so ""connected"" to the show as I did with Brooklyn 99.

It became a part of me so much that I feel empty now that I watched it all. So the one thing that will keep me alive is the thought that I can always start watching it again - be it the whole series or some single episodes.

Now that I watched it all I should be able to get every reference somebody makes to B99 and understand the context of every meme that I'll stumble upon here or elsewhere.

Yes, the title sort of says it all. I have watched many clips of the show, loved them all, but remember starting the pilot episode and just couldn't finish it.

I guess my question is, is it selfish to take the hush money? Is it the victim’s responsibility to prevent more bad things from happening at the expense of their own wellbeing? I know the stance the show was trying to make, and Keri seems to be fine with it. But I can’t help imagining if this happens to maybe like a receptionist, who may not have the capability to earn $100 mils in a quarter, who chose to take the life changing sum of money, and how guilty she must have felt.

I have asked friends, most of them support the show’s stance and said that taking the money makes you culpable in letting the perpetrators go and of any future harm they cause.

876,"Inconsistency #1 I’ve re-watched Brooklyn Nine-Nine over 10 times and I have come across many inconsistencies that I would like to share with everyone and get some conversations started.

In S6:E6 “The Crime Scene”

Holt tells Jake that Montez and Dillman were the best detectives he has worked with.

But in S7:E9 “Dillman”

Jake asks Holt since Dillman is no longer the best detective he has worked with, who is?
Holt responds with Lesley Hawk Minkoff (Basing this on memory, don’t know if that is the exact name)

What happened to Montez? If Dillman isn’t the best anymore wouldn’t that make Montez the new best?",brooklynninenine

I think Ted Danson would've made an amazing villain, something similar to Eric Roberts as Jimmy Figgis. Also, in a fictional universe, Leslie Knope and Amy Santiago would really bond over their love for binders.",brooklynninenine

After that, it was just a new person winning each time which got boring because I knew captain holt or Jake would never win again.

She’s able to match Sheldon’s talent in physics, collaborated with him and won the Nobel in physics with him, even tho she doesn’t have a PhD in physics.

1008,"Reason Why Bernadette became ""Mean"" (Long Post) I was just watching S3E5 (Creepy Candy Coating) episode, in this episode Bernadette and Howard meet for the first time on their double date with Leonard and Penny. So, as the date progresses they start to bond over their overbearing mothers who had unhealthy relationships with them.   


So, Bernadette here says : 

Bernadette Rostenkowski: I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.

Bernadette Rostenkowski: Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at work to see if you've had a healthy lunch?

Bernadette Rostenkowski: Okay, well does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning, like you're nine years old?

Howard Wolowitz: You live with your mother?

Bernadette Rostenkowski: No. That's the sad part.

Howard Wolowitz: Oh. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldn't pick up a disease from the other children.

Bernadette Rostenkowski: That's nothing. I couldn't ride a bicycle 'cause my mother was afraid I'd hit a bump and lose my virginity.  


This dialogue justifies that her mother was over controlling and made her crazy.  


So, when Bernadette got her job she did not have any financial obligations over her and then she lifted her veil of putting up with shit from her mother, this as usual went a little too far and in turn she became totally unhinged and was not afraid of being sounding rude to people because of all she's been through.",bigbangtheory

Hello everyone,

Fellow TBBT superfan here

Just wanted to say that I breathe TBBT and have watched SO many clips that I lost track of the number. So it made sense that a few months ago I got the idea to write a fanfic. Now it's out  and it would be great if you could check it out.

I'm really excited about my TBBT fanfic because I think it captures the spirit of the show and brings the characters to life in a way that I don't think has been done before. It's a story that really breathes new life into the show.

I am sure each one of you on this subreddit and reading this post wants to know SO BADD what the gang get up to in Pasadena. What I also know is that you want an alternate ending for Raj and you want to see Penny coping with her unexpected pregnancy

My fanfic will tackle al that and there is also a  cool Shamy arc and even COOLER Howie and Bernie arc.

I have linked the story below so would you kindly read the story and comment down below any thoughts or critique you have for me ( the more detailed the better) and  if u don't follow the A/N u will get spiders in ur bed!

It’s where Sheldon is in a suit and he greets Amy at her apartment, he’s sitting in a chair and he’s being all SeDuCtIvE and stuff lol. I remember he looks HAWT. Could someone please tell me which episode this is? I think this will be the evidence I need to prove her wrong.
Thanks guys! Hahaha :)",bigbangtheory

I mean I thought Rajesh would finally meet his soul mate, but he is still left behind like he was in the beginning of the show, and I really would have liked to see Leonard and Penny having there baby together but the show ended on a somewhat cliff hanger. 

Plus the show ended a year before Covid and would have been really hysterical seeing Sheldon reacting to it. 

Was there like a reason the show ended?

1106,"Watching Young Sheldon for the first time! Thoughts so far. So I'm on Season 4 Ep 4 so far and I'm really liking it. The family is just so realistic, sometimes uncomfortably so. Notes:  


\-Everybody is so unnecessarily mean to Georgie! Despite what everyone says about him, he's actually pretty smart and responsible but his parents especially just don't give him any credit. He learned how to be a good salesman, got a job, bought the cable he wanted and bought himself a car all before being done high school, and even paid his boss his personal savings for the lost cash when he screwed up on his job. Nobody gives him any credit, stan georgie.

\-Missy is a girlboss, that's all. Shame it seems like she doesn't keep her wisecracks and streetsmarts as an adult (referring to her appearance in TBBT, though if I'm wrong about this forgive me, it's been a LONG time since I last saw TBBT)

\-Really genuinely shocked ol' meemaw didn't get back with Dr Sturgis, it really felt like they would get back together after the doctor was starting to feel regret. Don't care that much for the new dude but with how sitcoms usually go I feel like Dr Sturgis will get another chance.

\-Paige is a really interesting character and kind of sad so far, starts out as the young genius but gets more and more demoralized from where her smarts get her and is clearly suffering from what her family situation did to her. I hope things turn out well for her.

1114,"The gang decide to meet exactly 20 years from the present and only Stewart shows up. Is this canon? (S7E18) At the end of the episode, after Raj's murder mystery game ends, the gang decide to meet in exactly 20 years for dinner. They all add it to their phone calendars. The scene cuts. 

It cuts a scene in the future. It shows the front of the apartment building which is their meeting spot. Stewart is the only one who shows up there - he's the only one to fulfil their pact 20 years earlier. 

Is this canon? Does this cutaway scene show the actual lore of this show in 20 years? If it does, it also shows something else. Futuristic, glowy smooth vehicles. I think this is quite silly for a 2 year prediction. It's a very cartoony presentation of future vehicles. 

So is this just a comedic cutaway? Many past and future scenes from shows are not necessarily canon, but some at least make this obvious. Here I'm a bit unsure. If it's canon, 1. That's shitty of everyone. 2. It's sad that it implies they're all too busy with their own individual lives. 3. Stewart was the only one to follow through, and he should be proud. This also implies they don't keep in contact with each other, or at least with Stewart. Otherwise they would have discussed it over messegss right? 4. Silly rediculous looking futuristic cars actually happen at least in this specific location (like their suburb). Who can say how such a shift in aesthetics occured.

1. Bernadette had no business in making that costume for Howard. It's between him and Sheldon. She is a vile person who's always overly hurtful to others. Self righteous woman with a superiority complex and little regard for others.


2. Amy is a creep. She's overly clingy, manipulative, and downright psychotic. And no, she's not pretty even if most of the people say otherwise. She looks like a goblin.


3. Howard was a creep, and he really likes to put others down. Even after that, he seemed like the most stable one by the end.


4. Raj is a spoilt brat who always wants more. Man had a girlfriend but broke up when he merely talked with another girl, already imagining having a relationship with the new girl. What an ass.


5. Penny was delt a bad hand by the writers. Poor girl had to settle for Leonard and drown herself in alcohol. An unfulfilled life and settling for what was available.


6. Sheldon definitely has ASD. Not all autistic people are like him, but not all are great as well, like Shawn Murphy. Sheldon was coddled when he was a kid, and his disorder was never addressed by anyone. If it was, he could've been helped. Mary Cooper's helicopter parenting created adult Sheldon.


7. Leonard is a narcissist. A self-centered, selfish, and manipulative man who would betray his friends for sex. He makes everything about himself. Despite Raj's protests, he hooks up with the guy's sister. If I was in Raj's place, I'd have beaten him black and blue. He had the gall to act betrayed when Raj and Penny seemingly hooked up. He tried to manipulate Sheldon into letting him woo Missy and put the other 2 down. 

Cheating, professional sabotage, lying to take advantage of others, forcing himself on Penny when she clearly wasn't interested and even manipulating her into having sex with him, superiority complex, extremely opinionated... Man will do anything for personal gain and pleasure. And, he's absolutely remorseless. 


Leonard reminds me of Ed Kemper.

She's a loyal and supportive partner, she's super smart, and she can hang with both the guys and Penny and Amy seamlessly. I also love the surprises like her unexpectedly kinky side and the fact that she hates kids (a trait I 💯 relate to). And whenever she snaps back at Howard's mom, I can't help but crack up.

If a person is to live a better life, it is important to care about small things. People make fun of him for having an enemies list, keeping track of his bowel movements, characterising his travel outfits according to weather occasion, having a weekly blast etc. but deep down it feels so soothing and fulfilling that someone is organised enough to maintain all that stuff. I personally look up to him and take ideas from his lifestyle to incorporate into mine.  

His opinions on gender blindness and stuff - I would love to see that in the real world. Im a girl and I’ve personally seen my other girl friends reject the option of engineering because of it being a male dominated field. 

I mean I get it, he has quirks and is often oblivious to social cues  - that’s because the people in the show are so used to mocking him or treating him wrong that they fail to help him improve. Amy deserves a round of applause for being that person who helped Sheldon improve his emotional intelligence.

Overall, I would love a group of friends like Sheldon’s - altering the interest in video games and Star Trek and changing it into robotics.

I’m on season 10 right now where someone from her work congratulated her on being pregnant and then she finds out Penny was the one who told on her. I guess what annoys me the most is how fixated Bernadette was on making Barbara Chen who she believed told everyone pay when she herself admitted that she had told everyone that Barbara Chen was pregnant which in turn cost her a promotion. Bernadette says that Barbara Chen screwed with her job and so she must pay for that possibly by finding ways to get her fired which is beyond hypocritical because she literally did the exact same thing to her and from the looks of it Bernadette didn’t get any payback seeing as she’s still thriving at work. There’s quite a few instances on the show and especially in her work environment where Bernadette is highlighted as being a horrible person and a bully but it’s particularly frustrating because the writers spin it into it’s okay and cute because she tiny and adorable and I wish at least once we’d seen her truly be called out for this behaviour. Even her yelling at Amy for getting Apple slices at McDonalds rather than French fries?!?! I think it would’ve been nice to have her not be rewarded with the promotion by threatening her boss and rather for the promotion to have given been given to Barbra Chen which would have discredited any claims she had of discrimination and also if at some point in the episode she realised how wrong her behaviour towards Barbara Chen was rather than her self righteous attitude,bigbangtheory

And then he said he would take care of it as he is a romance ninja - kisses, love ,hugs etc. How penny dismisses him saying he's not cool and she made him cooler but he does these kinds of things.  


This scene was pretty bad regarding Penny, I really hate when she is mean to Leonard when he's trying to do the right thing, she's just playing her popular girl schtick where any kind of effort is desperate and should not be done or enjoyed.   


As the episode runs along she also does these sorts of things at double date as well.

In S10, E5, when Sheldon goes out with Penny to ""pick up some girls"" (I know he wasn't gonna do that, but still), he explains why he knocks three times. He said that  when he was thirteen years old, he came home and found his father having relations with another woman in his parents’ bedroom. That’s why he always knocks three times. But what does three knocks have to do with anything? Because it doesn't matter how much he knocks. He only comes in when the person inside the room tells him to come in.

If he was falling in love and having an entire emotional affair behind the screen with the person controlling the character that’s a different story but if it was just a one time weird occurrence does it really matter ?

1482,"New to the show So I just started watching BBT after all these years (started watching Young Sheldon before this lol), and currently, I am on season 5. So based on the seasons I have watched so far, I wanted to rank the characters based on their characteristics and whatnot. Please don't hate me, this is just my opinion.  


1) Leonard and Howard  
Probably the ones that seem the most normal out of the four guys. A perfect mix of socializing and brains. Leonard makes the most sensible decisions and looks like has some experience in life, but that could have to do with him being with penny. Howard is the only one who does not have a PhD, yet is still on par with everyone else and also the only one who has a degree in Engineering, setting himself apart from others. Although, it is a weird relationship between Howard and his mother, not because he is still living with his mom (totally fine), but with the way those two communicate like always screaming and shouting.

2) Penny and Bernadette   
Penny is the only character in the show who isn't academically driven which makes her stand out from the rest. She is funny and thinks practically and is basically how a normal person in todays world would live like. Bernadette also acts normally with reference to other people. She is smart but doesn't show it.

3) Raj  
He basically portrays of what it would be like to live as a person with such high stature in the academic world. Reading comics, shy around girls, only has a few friends, still afraid of his Indian parents etc. Throughout the show he makes really funny jokes in the sidelines. Something that doesn't seem right is his very very close friendship with Howard and there have been instances in the show where Howard's mother says is it the Indian boy who always comes around and sleeps in your bed and blah blah etc. 

4) Amy and Sheldon  
Sheldon in the BBT is basically a child genius stuck in the body of an adult. Him in the Young Sheldon and in big bang, are somewhat different. You'd think he would change and progress in his personality development as he ages, but he seems to just have gone a mark below. Although, he is pretty funny and makes some jokes which basically steal the show right from the start. His constant mockery of his friends as to how they are not very smart and indulge in normal life activities is kinda annoying. Amy is downright the character that I do not like. She is, idk how to say this but, irritating. Always thirsty for Sheldon and Penny as well. Like she literally keeps telling Penny to go naked and also kisses her when they are drunk in a few episodes. She also flirts with her all the time when they are together. Same goes with Sheldon, she constantly bickers him into kissing her and having intercourse with her even though he seems weirded out by this.  
I liked sheldon more in Young Sheldon than in BBT.

he has flaws obviously, personal struggles don’t justify being jerk. but having the whole finale dedicated to “sheldon’s so selfish” still doesn’t feel justified.

- loads of funny moments
- the characters (most of the time)
- tons of great episodes
- the chemistry between the cast
- the guest stars
- the acting
- the sad/serious moments are well done
- the side characters
- the character development
- the weddings

What I disliked/hated
- the last three or so seasons were pretty boring
- The way Sheldon treats everybody (especially Amy)
- Bernadette became so unlikeable near the end
- abandoned plots, like the air force project.
- continuity errors
- overusing the audience laughter
- some bad or boring episodes

1613,"Storyline inconsistencies Not sure if this has been discussed already but I was rewatching the show and I can’t stop thinking about how incoherent the storyline is. Like did the writers make a note of what they were saying in previous episodes at all??

- Sheldon getting confused by Raj speaking in Hindi: “jo ji kare kar - whatever floats your boat” but then he said in a later season that he learnt Hindi when he was 8 years old?? Also Raj said in the later seasons that doesn’t underhand Hindi as he never spoke it as a child.

- Sheldon being anti-cats in S1 when Leonard was heartbroken and listening to emo music then ended up getting 6 cats when he and Amy broke up in S4.

- S6 Penny saying she knew tons of people that got married in Vegas and then suggesting Howard and Bernadette get married there when they couldn’t finalise a venue. But then in S8 she said that she got married to Zack in Vegas as a joke because Vegas weddings were fake. 

- Sheldon suggesting Penny’s mum was fat when she takes the last dumpling that was meant for the most respected member of the group but in S9 when her family visit for the wedding, Penny’s mother is fairly lean. 

Does anyone else still love the show but feels like the inconsistency of the storyline makes it a little difficult to watch it again?

Edit- also as a young Sheldon fan, the two shows rarely have any similarities. Grown up Sheldon’s version of his childhood is so distant from young Sheldon’s life. Like him saying his parents got him a dirt bike for his 11th birthday but watching YS I can tell his parents knew him very well and would never have gotten him a dirt bike. Mary is hyper attentive to his needs and wants and the suggestion of buying a dirt bike would’ve been squashed at the speed of light.",bigbangtheory

Howard giving Penny a teddy bear with a webcam in

Sheldon saying Marie Curie was an 'honorary man' because of her accomplishments in science-

Sheldon saying to Penny ' The trouble isn’t with me, Penny, it’s with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle'

Leonard enabling Howard and Raj when they sent military satellites and robot aircraft off course so they could spy on the models at the American Next Top Model house when they were topless.

Howard and Raj then even posed as electricians to trick the girls into letting them into their house-

When Penny finally defended herself to Howard and the guys made her feel bad about it so SHE apologized to HIM for defending herself against his constant sexual harrassment. There's also instances where she's literally just trying to eat dinner and he's hitting on her constantly like when she responded by saying 'Not with a thousand condoms, Howard' so he keeps it going by saying 'Oh so there IS a number' (some of these are quite harmless on their own but they're alarming when they're all laid out together)

Howard operating a remote control car to drive under Penny's skirt then after the boys laughed for a while, Raj said 'You might want to put some underwear on'

The show also contributed to that disturbing sitcom trope where they'd talk about getting girls drunk to make them easier to hook up with as if that's ok

I remember hating Sheldon's assistant as a kid but now that I've re-watched the things he said to her, she was right to report him - an actual sentence he said to her 'Your ovaries are oozing so much goofy-juice into your brain that you don't know which way is up'

Whenever Penny is upset, Sheldon asks if she's on her period or offers her products that would imply she is - he even estimated how many periods she'd have left and once even asked if she was regular

When Raj literally convinced Penny they'd had sex (which is a crime by the way) and then we he finally told her, it wasn't even because of the emotional distress she was going through, he told her after her relationship when Leonard had already been affected and then made her promise to keep it a secret

Raj being extremely misogynistic but never facing consequences because he was drunk e.g. that time he stripped off in front of a woman in a coffee shop or propositioned a woman interviewing him for a job at the university to move the interview to his hot tub but then told the rest of his friends he didn't get the job because she was racist - there's a difference between guys being nervous around women and guys just committing sexual harassment

Sheldon said to his female lab assistant 'Women are like an egg salad sandwich on a warm day: full of eggs and only appealing for a short time '

All the dumb blonde bimbo/Penny being a slut because she'd slept with multiple guys jokes they'd make that seemed to spill over into the real-life harrassment Kaley Cuoco who plays Penny would get from male fans of the show. I've seen so many forums online calling her disgusting names and saying they'd prefer Bernadette purely because she was more 'virginal' when regardless of her sexual history, Penny was a much better friend/person

The double standards with the shit Penny got for hooking up with Raj when she didn't actually compared to Penny just having to get over Leonard cheating her, Sheldon never disclosing his assistant kissed him and choosing to work with her despite knowing she had a serious crush on him whilst he had a girlfriend, Howard constantly flirting with other girls despite being engaged and then married to Bernadette; after Penny pointed out 'You're engaged to my best friend', Howard replies 'Bernie doesn't mind where I get my motor running as long as I park in the right garage'. He also constantly comes out with seemingly harmless jokes that become unbearably creepy when you put them all together and also acknowledge that he just goes up to women and these are the first things he says like 'You turn my software into hardware'  and 'What up, science bitches?' He would say uncomfortable lines like 'The way I see it, I'm halfway to pity-sex' or how Leonard would always discuss his sex life with Penny without her permission and Howard would say things like 'You got her to have sex with you; obviously, your power is brainwashing'

The way Howard expected Bernadette to have his children then stay at home to raise them despite her making more money than him/being more of an accomplished scientist and since he was the one to want kids - not her - he should have been raising them. He also expected her to clean up after him/cook for him like his mum used to and she did!

How the show never gave Penny a surname until she married Leonard

Them referring to Penny as white trash because she came from Nebraska

Money is not a reflection of love but Howard buying Bernadette a half a carat for a ring when he can clearly afford more and telling his cousin 'her freakishly small hands make anything look big'- Penny ending up pregnant when she never wanted kids felt like a huge betrayal to her character - especially since she agreed to Leonard being a sperm donor to her ex-boyfriend's new wife

There's an episode where Sheldon and Amy combine their genes/brain cells and after its success, he not only tells Bernadette that theirs is more advanced than the baby she's currently pregnant with but he then tries to persuade Amy multiple times to make a baby with him. After she repeatedly tells him no, he decides 'She's playing hard to get' and takes more drastic action to 'seduce' her which is just an incredibly problematic mindset

Sheldon saying 'I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman'

Howard saying to Leonard and Raj 'My wife came with both fun bags and money bags' to which they both laugh

Howard not wanting Bernadette to be friends with other guys in earlier seasons because Leonard was interested in her work and how Leonard later on constantly made comments about wanting Penny to quit acting because A: he essentially wanted to date a girl who seemed smarter so he could finally get approval from his mother and B: he was always incredibly jealous of any guy she'd have to work with on set which was her literal job

Sheldon saying to Penny 'No-one can be that attractive and skilled at a video game'

I'll finish this with Sheldon and Raj arguing over which Bollywood actress is better between Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit: Sheldon calls Aishwarya Rai 'a poor man’s Madhuri Dixit' to which Raj says: 'Aishwarya Rai is a goddess - by comparison, Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute'. Netflix received legal action to remove this episode from their platform for derogatory comments.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of people are going to say 'It's just a show' which is the entire problem; I'm fully aware but I just want to have a fair discussion about its effects on certain members of its audience because it feels like no-one cares and I used to love the show as a kid but grew up realizing this was a show that only loved a portion of its viewers.  Another argument is that Sheldon didn't seem to realize he was being mean/he was inept of social cues...except he actually just got to a point where he seemed fully aware of the things he said but just didn't care; others would point it out and he even learned to recognize his nastiness on his but the show seemed to stick with the idea 'We can write whatever crap we want because we've established this character doesn't know it's wrong so we've found a loophole and don't need to address it'. Lots of people enjoyed this show but lots of people were hurt, I still find it entertaining but you can still like the show and also acknowledge that these things are not ok.

Edit: It seems most people ignored everything I've said or even refused to read it and have just responded with hateful criticism instead of having a discussion which unfortunately proves my point. There are also many other issues which need to be covered but I'm just focusing on the sexism angle.",bigbangtheory

1684,"First time watching the *entire* show and here's my thoughts  

I've been a fan of ""The Big Bang Theory"" for a long time, and I feel like a part of this quirky community. Each character is special to me, but I have to say that two characters in particular, Raj and Amy, have a lot of issues.

We all know that every character is flawed, but the rest of the cast seems to make up for their flaws with other good traits or through self-improvement. For example, Penny grows from being a bully to recognizing when she's wrong and considering others' feelings. Howard starts as a pervy, sex-obsessed character, but over time, he becomes a dedicated father and loving husband. Bernadette can be spiteful, but she usually feels bad about it quickly. Leonard learns to stand up for himself and not let Penny walk all over him, while Sheldon, despite being the least redeemable, still shows growth in his relationships and independence.

However, Amy and Raj seem to be the exceptions. Amy starts out as a quiet, intelligent woman with a snarky tone, but over time, she becomes a sex-craved pervert who treats her best friend like a sex object and talks about her best friend's husband like he's trash. She also deliberately sets Sheldon off any chance she gets to cause drama between his friends. One example is the Halloween party, where Howard dresses as Sheldon and makes tame jokes about him. Sheldon gets offended and sulks in his office. Instead of telling Sheldon to grow up, Amy gaslights Bernadette into thinking Howard is in the wrong. When Bernadette explains how Sheldon constantly belittles her husband, Amy spitefully ruins the Halloween party by showing up dressed as Bernadette and Howard, insulting Bernadette's voice, height, and body. Amy is a toxic, delusional character who feeds into Sheldon's ego and selfishness, and she constantly talks badly about him behind his back. She's great when she's not with Sheldon, but when they're on screen together, she's a horrible human being and a terrible friend.

As for Raj, he's a spoiled man-child who gets everything handed to him. Even seven seasons in, when everyone else has sorted their lives out and started to become better people, Raj is still lying, manipulating, twisting the truth, and leeching off both his friends and family. He's consistently ungrateful and disloyal to his friends, often gaslighting them and ignoring their boundaries.

For instance, Raj has been known to break into Howard's house multiple times just to use his Jacuzzi and has a habit of turning important moments in Howard's life into Raj-centric pity parties. In one episode, he gaslights Howard into thinking that he caused all of Raj's problems just because he made light-hearted jokes at his expense, despite Raj doing the same to Howard.

His behavior is genuinely psychotic at times, such as when he backstabs Penny after she discovers a comet, gaslights her, and then tries to guilt trip her and Leonard into letting him get away with it. Even in later seasons, Raj continues to mistreat the people who love and support him. For example, when Howard gets invited to speak at Raj's planetarium, Raj's first reaction is an outburst in front of his boss, screaming that Howard isn't allowed to do it out of pure jealousy and spite. In another instance, Raj gets a big break on TV but spends the entire interview badmouthing Neil deGrasse Tyson simply because he's envious of Tyson's success and respect.

Raj also contributes to his parents' divorce by spreading rumors and falsehoods, all for his own financial gain. In his romantic life, he dismisses Emily, the only woman who genuinely loved him, because she was a bit too kinky in bed. It seems that Raj doesn't really want a partner with a personality, but rather a submissive sex slave who'll cater to his every whim.

Every character has bad moments and good moments, the difference is that everyone else seems to learn and grow from the bad while enjoying the good but Amy and Raj try their absolute best to cause drama and hatred to spread within the group at every turn, all the while showcasing horrible, twisted personalities that are revealed anytime someone says as much as ""no"" to them or disagrees with a horrible thing they've done. They genuinely nearly ruined the show for me but luckily other characters made up for them.",bigbangtheory

All of his dialogue and his  conversations with Howard about racism and women are apt.

After season 5 his character became too imaginative. He became a loner and desperate for love. I mean if you have a degree from Cambridge and come from a rich Indian family. You will either be spoilt or too humble for this world. Raj is a spoilt child. It is too unusual to have a character development like this and its disappointing. There could have been so many darker jokes made out of his character. I don't know why they had to make him such a cutiepie and sad while the rest of them were settling in their life .

1766,"The Scavenger Hunt Episode is just so great I've always loved the big bang theory since watching reruns on TV like 10 years ago as a teenager with limited access to entertainment. 

A couple years back I watched the whole thing through to the end and did enjoy it, but agreed that there was a noticeable dip in quality in the later seasons. I started rewatching a few weeks ago, but as the seasons have gone on I've increasingly just been half watching while doing other stuff. It's a nice comforting background show that didn't demand my full attention. 

The scavenger hunt episode, though, made me sit up and take notice. I was glued to the screen throughout the episode and there was just so much I liked about it. 

The Big Bang theory back in season 1 started with such a simple premise that was inevitably starting to wear thin after multiple seasons since the show was more successful than anybody probably expected. Therefore, it made sense to have more of an ensemble cast and give the show more longevity by building up the different dynamics between characters and allowing them to play off of each other. 

The scavenger hunt does this is an interesting way by creating pairs that aren't usually seen interacting one on one (except Sheldon and Penny but I'll get to that). The pairs work great together and the episode as a whole is just a delight in the way it deviates from the normal structure of mainly group scenes talking with everyone being reasonably relaxed, to a more fast paced and competitive setting where you get a lot of one on one interactions outside of the usual Leonard/Sheldon, Leonard/Penny, Howard/Raj, and Howard/Bernadette, which are really the main common 1 on 1 dynamics seen in the show. 

Pair 1: Penny and Sheldon

Now Penny and Sheldon were the least exciting pair for me because they are seen interacting relatively regularly, and seeing them talk or be at odds or tension with each other isn't new. Still, though, it's a pleasant pairing, as even though Sheldon/Penny isn't a novel prospect like the others, it is a winning combination in my view, and having read this subreddit, it seems a lot of others agree with my opinion that they're good together. Through sheer familiarity the two are very comfortable with each other despite being probably the two most different characters on the show. Sheldon is probably one of the only men Penny has interacted with as an adult who isn't remotely interested in her romantically, and this is a double-edged sword for her as it means he won't make unwanted advances on her, which means she is more comfortable. However, he also won't pull punches with her and will call her out on things (her messy apartment, her check engine light, etc.) That a lot of guys wouldn't, because they're worried about offending her and ruining their chances with her. After years in each other's companies the two are both well aware of each other's idiosyncrasies and flaws, and have long since come to terms with them. They have a nice thing going on where Penny helps Sheldon with social skills and processing emotion, while Sheldon helps her improve her general knowledge and be better informed about the world. In a lot of ways, how well they worked together in the scavenger hunt was emblematic of how beautifully two people you'd think would never get on have grown together. Penny respects Sheldon's problem-solving skills and the two generally encourage each other, despite the bickering over things like the bowling ball that are inevitable between two people who are so close. Their scenes were fun, but nothing overly revolutionary compared to what the rest of the show had already built between them. 

Pair 2: Howard and Amy 

Howard and Amy are two characters that essentially have nothing to do with each other, and this is made clear by their initial awkwardness in the car together. However, it was great seeing them bond over Neil Diamond as they both do have a similar goofy/childlike nature when their guard is down, and both are used to having unusual interests that others don't find accessible, so their mutual bliss at having something in common to bond over is really beautiful. As funny as the Neil Diamond obsession was, though, I do wish that they had used it to further develop a more meaningful friendship between Howard and Amy, rather than just extending that one joke for the whole episode and calling it a day, it's one of my few gripes with this episode. 

Pair 3: Leonard and Bernadette

Leonard and Bernadette were by far my favourite pair of the video. Bernadette is well and truly a main character at this point and it is strange that we as the audience know almost nothing about her relationship with Leonard. I have mixed feelings about Bernadette's mean quips usually, some are hilarious and some are a bit meh, but I love her this episode and it was definitely my favourite pairing comedy-wise. When she's criticising Leonards driving while talking about how he didn't get put on a team with Penny and goes ""I'm starting to think she dodged a bullet... the slowest bullet it the world"" I had a good laugh. It was all in the delivery and I felt her heckling of Leonard was funny without crossing the line into excessive meanness. It would have been nice to see the two reconcile and bond a little more, but I suppose it at least gives insight into why the two don't interact more regularly. 

Overall, it was a fantastic episode and really reinvigorated my spirit in watching the latter half of the series.",bigbangtheory

1791,"Mary vs Beverly This is probably going to be a very unpopular opinion, but brace yourself. 

In TBBT, we always see how Mary is a great mother to Shelly, while Beverly is despicably awful towards Leonard. That's something everyone can agree on. 

But we also hear how Beverly seem very proud of Leonard's siblings. And even in TBBT, but especially in Young Sheldon, we see how Mary is at best dismissive of Missy and Georgie, because she loves and care for Shelly a gazillion time more. And no matter how much of a selfish brat Sheldon is, or how much emotional support Missy tries to provide her - let alone how Georgie provides and support her and Missy after George death. It's always about Shelly in her mind and heart. 

So this all makes me wondering. If we had the perspective of Michael Hofstadter or his sister on Beverly as a mother. Or Missy and Georgie's perspective of Mary as a mother. Now, obviously, for one thing, Mary did not write books about how Georgie and Missy were a constant disappointment to her, so that's a good point for her that she kept that for private audience. But with what we see in Young Sheldon, I'm starting to think that Mary and Beverly, on many regards, are just to other side of the same coin to Sheldon and Leonard (and/or to their other kids). 

Beverly is certainly worse, but Mary still has a lot in common with her when it comes to Missy and Georgie...",bigbangtheory

""As the final episode of The Big Bang Theory comes to a close, the gang sits around in their apartment, reminiscing about all the good times they've had together over the years. Suddenly, there's a loud explosion outside, and the lights in the apartment flicker.

The gang rushes to the window to see what's happening, and they see a massive mushroom cloud rising up in the distance. It becomes clear that a nuclear bomb has gone off, and the world as they know it is coming to an end.

With tears streaming down their faces, the gang holds each other tightly as they realize that they'll never get to experience any more adventures or make any more memories together. They're all going to die, and there's nothing they can do about it.

As the radiation begins to seep into their apartment, the gang huddles together and tries to stay strong, but it's no use. One by one, they begin to succumb to the effects of the radiation poisoning, until eventually, they're all gone.

The final shot of the series is of the empty, radioactive apartment, as the camera pans out to show a desolate wasteland where once there was a bustling city. The laughter and joy that once filled that apartment are gone forever, replaced only by the sad silence of a world that's been destroyed.""",bigbangtheory

1874,"The Evolution of Penny: A Tribute to the Amazing Character Let's take a moment to appreciate the evolution of one of its most beloved characters: Penny.

From the very first episode, we were introduced to Penny as the beautiful, outgoing waitress who lived across the hall from the nerdy and socially awkward Leonard and Sheldon. She was initially portrayed as a stereotypical ""dumb blonde,"" but as the series progressed, her character developed into so much more.

Throughout the show's 12 seasons, we watched Penny grow and evolve in remarkable ways. She went from a struggling actress to a pharmaceutical sales representative and eventually, a successful businesswoman. She faced challenges in her personal and professional life, including failed relationships, career setbacks, and struggles with addiction.

But through it all, Penny remained a strong and resilient character, with a kind heart and an infectious personality. Her relationship with Leonard was a central theme throughout the series, and we saw her mature and learn to navigate the complexities of love and commitment.

Beyond her romantic relationships, Penny's friendships with the guys were also a highlight of the show. She initially struggled to understand their quirky interests and intellectual pursuits, but over time, she came to appreciate and embrace their unique personalities and passions.

One of the most remarkable things about Penny's evolution was how relatable and realistic it was. She wasn't a perfect character, and she made mistakes along the way, but she always learned from them and grew stronger as a result.

As we look back on the show, it's clear that Penny was an integral part of the ensemble cast, and her evolution throughout the series was a testament to the show's strong writing and character development.

So here's to you, Penny - thank you for making us laugh, cry, and root for you throughout the years. You will always hold a special place in our hearts.

Sincerely,
A fan of ""The Big Bang Theory""",bigbangtheory

I’ve rewatched the whole Big Bang series a lot of times, but this time I noticed something strange.

In the pilot episode, Sheldon’s ability to pick up social cues is really good. He immediately picks up on Leonard trying to pamper Penny and says that she’s not going to have sex with him and then provides an explanation that is closely tied to just observing Penny and her social status and comparing it to Leonard’s.

And another thing, he’s not entirely repulsed by human contact or by sex. He says something along the lines of “It’s been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out”.

Holt told them to leave the precinct alone or else she would be “wuntch meat” ☠️ which I’m guessing everyone assumed he meant that he would show the recording to her bosses and get her fired. There are multiple occasions where holt could’ve used it on wuntch when she was trying to ruin his career Eg he could’ve used it when she promoted him to the public relations office And Another example is when she demoted him to a police officer (which was techinically fair because he hadn’t spent a full year as a uniformed officer as required but he still could’ve used that blackmail). there was never really a clear answer since it was never brought up again.

 Sheldon and Amy work in super-asymmetry, and then they grieve their work when they find out it was disproven years ago. But then Sheldon finds encouragement from the last source he ever thought he would, his late father, imparting his wisdom one last time.

Raj comes to terms with his loneliness and his issues, and realizes that he doesn't need to marry Anu just because he's running out of time, his perfect woman is out there somewhere.

And the most impactful one for me was Leonard finally accepting his mother, and forgiving her for hurting him, and more importantly forgiving himself for agonizing over her for years. As someone who has their own parental issues, Leonard has always been a character very close to my heart, and seeing him grow like this makes me realize that I probably can, too.

Her being Penny's best friend never made sense to me. When Leonard and Priya got together she kept pointing out how Priya is better than Penny every chance she got. 


Also, when Penny and Bernadette had a rift, she was literally happy about it and sucking up to each of them every chance she got.
